              <b>DROGON IS ONE</b> of the dragons born in the Dothraki sea. Commanded by Daenerys Targaryen, he is named for her dead husband, Drogo. Drogon is believed to be the reincarnation of Balerion the Black Dread, but Daenerys decides to give him a new name for his new life. The largest and most aggressive of Daenerys's three dragons, Daenerys has problems reining him in.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drogon's scales are black, his horns and spinal plates are blood red,and his eyes are smouldering red pits. His teeth are black as well. His flame is black fire shot with red and the wash of its heat can be felt thirty feet away. His wing flap sounds like the clap of thunder. He bleeds black blood. As of A Dance with Dragons, Drogon's wings stretch twenty feet from tip-to-tip, black as jet.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Drogon's egg is black as the midnight sea, alive with scarlet ripples and swirls. The maegi Mirri Maz Duur proclaims that in order to bring new life one must give life. Daenerys Targaryen burns the body of her deceased husband, Khal Drogo, along with Mirri Maz Duur herself and the three eggs, giving life to Drogon and his brothers, Viserion and Rhaegal.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next book, when Daenerys arrives in Qarth, Drogon along with the other dragons are a marvel to the inhabitants of the ancient city. Drogon is on her shoulder when she enters Qarth. When Daenerys receives the news from Quhuru Mo of Robert I Baratheon's death Drogon is seated in her lap. He hisses and pale smoke rises before Daenerys's face like a veil. When Daenerys enters the House of the Undying, she has Drogon accompany her. Once inside, Drogon reacts to the visions that Daenerys has. When they come upon the Undying, Drogon defends Daenerys by attacking the pulsating heart that stands at the center of the room, thereby slaying the Undying. This allows Daenerys to escape the House and seems to have seriously damaged the structure itself.
