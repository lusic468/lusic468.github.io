              <b>ARYA STARK IS</b> the third child and second daughter of Lord Eddard Stark and Lady Catelyn Tully. A member of House Stark, she has five siblings: brothers Robb, Bran, Rickon, half-brother Jon Snow, and older sister Sansa.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine years old at the start of A Game of Thrones, Arya is a spirited girl interested in fighting and exploration, unlike her older sister, Sansa. Arya wants to learn how to fight with a sword and ride in tourneys, to the horror of Sansa, who enjoys the more traditional pursuits of a noblewoman. Arya is particularly close to her half brother Jon Snow, who encourages her martial pursuits. Jon Snow gives Arya her first sword, Needle, as a gift. Throughout her travels, Arya displays great resourcefulness, cunning, and an unflinching ability to accept hard necessity. She is said to take after her fiery aunt Lyanna in temperament.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arya's appearance is more Stark than Tully, with a long face, grey eyes, and brown hair. She is skinny and athletic. At the start of the story, she is generally regarded as plain, as exemplified by her nickname "Arya Horseface", and often mistaken for a boy. However, there are instances of her being called pretty, compared to the beautiful Lyanna, and catching the eye of men later in the books. In Braavos the kindly man says she has a pretty face.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is left-handed, quick, and dexterous. She learned basic swordplay in the Braavosi Water Dancer tradition and later learned how to handle knives. She is a warg, entering her direwolf Nymeria in her dreams, as well as cats in Braavos. She received a noble's education at Winterfell and is said to be good with mathematics and an excellent horse rider. She has proved to know at least a bit of High Valyrian. She also speaks Braavosi with a strong accent and has put some effort into learning the language, under orders from the kindly man. She has a quick and curious mind and a pragmatic outlook.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arya has spend her entire life at Winterfell, though she did accompany her father on two occasions to White Harbor. Arya has been tutored by Septa Mordane in the womenly arts (including needlework), and received lessons from maester Luwin as well. Arya was also taught to ride a horse, but due to being called Arya Horseface by Jeyne Poole because of her Stark looks, she could not enjoy the fact that riding horses was one of the few things she was better at than her older sister. Others at Winterfell would call her Arya Underfoot.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Eddard Stark often ate in the same hall as his staff, and always kept a seat next to him reserved, inviting a different member of his staff to dine with him each night. Arya loved listening to the stories these people would tell them.
