              <b>VISERION IS ONE</b> of the the dragons born in the Dothraki Sea, along with Drogon and Rhaegal. Commanded by Queen Daenerys Targaryen, he is named for her brother, Viserys Targaryen.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of Viserion's scales are cream, but his horns, wing bones and spinal crest are gold colored. His teeth are shining black daggers. His eyes are two pools of molten gold and his flame is pale gold shot through with red and orange. Viserion has a roar that would send a hundred lions running. Although his true color is cream he is often referred to as the white dragon. He knows his name.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Viserion's egg is colored pale cream streaked with gold. The maegi Mirri Maz Duur proclaims that in order to bring new life one had to give life. Daenerys burns Drogo's body, along with Mirri Maz Duur herself and the three eggs to give life to Viserion, along with his brothers, Drogon and Rhaegal.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next book, when Daenerys calls her people together and mounts her silver mare she is wearing her lion pelt and has Viserion on her shoulder. He sinks his sharp black claws into the lion's mane and coils his tail around her arm as she gives the order for her khalasar to follow the Red Comet.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Daenerys arrives in Qarth Viserion and the other dragons are a marvel in the ancient city. When Daenerys receives the news of the death of Robert I Baratheon, Viserion is on her shoulder. He flaps wings the color of cream, stirring the air.
