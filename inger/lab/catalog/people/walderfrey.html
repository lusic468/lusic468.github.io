              <b>WALDER FREY IS</b> the Lord of the Crossing and head of House Frey. Though almost ninety years old and infirm, he still maintains an active hand in the running of his house. Walder has become famous for siring many children and surviving many wives. He is to marry his eighth wife and has over a hundred descendants, base and trueborn. He has had twenty-two trueborn sons and seven trueborn daughters from his marriages, with an unknown number of bastard sons and daughters. He places a great emphasis on family loyalty, though his descendants jockey ruthlessly for his favor. Many Freys name their sons Walder and daughters Walda in hopes of honoring him.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walder is brittle, suffers from gout and is confined to a chair, although he brags that he still can produce progeny. Age has made him bald and toothless and his skin hangs loose. Walder has passed his weasely appearance and weak chin down to many of his descendants. He is a vain, prickly, ambitious, and untrustworthy man.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a toddler Walder was present at the marriage of his elder sister to Lord Ambrose Butterwell at Whitewalls. It is said he caused the marriage when he discovered his sister having intimate relations with a servant. Dunk thought that he was an extremely annoying child, and was sorely tempted to throw him down a well.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During Robert's Rebellion, Walder and his levies arrived at the Battle of the Trident after the rebels had already won. Hoster Tully, the Lord Paramount of the Trident, has since called his bannerman "the Late Lord Frey."
