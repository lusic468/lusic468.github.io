              <b>RAKHARO IS A</b> Dothraki horserider of Daenerys Targaryen's khas who later becomes one of her bloodriders.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert was once a renowned warrior with a good battlefield voice. In his youth he was described as very tall, broad shouldered and muscled like a maiden's fantasy. Eddard Stark estimates Robert's height at six feet and six inches, with his brothers slightly shorter. He kept himself clean shaven.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rakharo is older than Jhogo, he and has drooping black mustachios. Over the course of the series, Rakharo grows taller and more muscular, and he adds four new bells to his braid to represent his victories in battle.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Rakharo is one of four Dothraki warriors assigned to the khas of Daenerys Targaryen within the khalasar of Khal Drogo. He accompanies Daenerys during her visit to the Western Market in Vaes Dothrak, and is challenged by Quaro to a friendly eating contest. He helps stop an assassination attempt on Daenerys' life by a wineseller.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Daenerys attempted to heal Drogo with Mirri Maz Duur's aid, his bloodriders attempted to stop her. Haggo was killed by Rakharo in his attempt to stop Daenerys.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Daenerys names Rakharo ko and asks him to become one of her bloodriders alongside Aggo and Jhogo, she offers him the great curving arakh she received as a present during her wedding. He is at first reluctant, but he accepts after the dragons are born.
