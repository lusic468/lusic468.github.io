              <b>LADY LYSA ARRYN,</b> also known as Lysa Tully, is a member of House Tully. She is the youngest daughter of Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun and his wife, Lady Minisa Whent, and wife of Lord Jon Arryn, the Lord of the Eyrie and Hand of the King to King Robert I Baratheon. Since her husband's death, she is the Lady Regent of the Vale of Arryn.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Hoster Tully and Lord Tywin Lannister had been discussing a betrothal between Lysa and Jaime Lannister, the heir to Casterly Rock. This potential betrothal was off the table when King Aerys II Targaryen named Jaime to his Kingsguard in 281 AC. Lord Tywin offered his younger son, Tyrion, instead but was rebuffed by Lord Hoster, who stated that he wanted "a whole man" for Lysa. During Robert's Rebellion, Lysa was married to Lord Jon Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale. Lord Arryn was already an old man and their marriage forged a useful wartime alliance with House Tully. In addition, Jon needed a wife known to be fertile, as his last heir had died during the Battle of the Bells. She married Jon at Riverrun, in the same ceremony as her sister married Lord Eddard Stark, But unlike Catelyn's marriage, Lysa's had been hastily arranged. While she had wept much at the morning of their wedding, Lysa had been dry-eyed and radiant during the ceremony itself. Both Jon Arryn and Eddard Stark played key roles in the successful rebellion, and after the dubble wedding soon left to continue fighting. Lysa and Catelyn both remained at Riverrun, and when their moon blood did not come at the accustomed time, both girls believed they were pregnant, with Lysa convinced they were both pregnant with a son. While for Catelyn this was indeed the case, Lysa's moon blood came not much later, and "all the joy" went out of her. After Catelyn gave birth to Robb, she gave him to Lysa to hold, but, dissolving into tears, Lysa immediately gave the boy back to her sister.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the war ended, King Robert I Baratheon named Jon Arryn as his Hand on his coronation, a position that took him away to King's Landing for long periods of time. Additionally, Lysa's uncle, Ser Brynden Tully, who had been fighting with his older brother Hoster for years, took Lysa's marriage as an oppertunity to join the service of House Arryn, chosing to serve Lysa and her new husband instead, and informed his brother of this fact during Lysa's wedding feast.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jon was already a fairly old man when Lysa married him, and he was proud. Due to Jon's position as Hand of the King, the pair lived in King's Landing. Because of Lysa's soiled state and the age difference between them, theirs was a loveless marriage. In addition, Lysa had many troubles with childbirth. Including two boys and three girls, Lysa suffered two miscarriages in the Eyrie and three in King's Landing, and gave birth to two stillborn children. After suffering her last stillbirth, Lysa became paranoid, seeing enemies everywhere. She eventually gave birth to a son, Robert, in 292 AC. However, Robert is a sickly child, suffering from the 'shaking sickness'. Being her only living child, Lysa became overprotective, and would still be breastfeeding him when he was six years old.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lysa and her sister Catelyn last saw each other in 293 AC. Lysa also met Catelyn's eldest daughter, Sansa, though it is unknown whether these two events occured at the same time.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite her marriage, Lysa did not forget Petyr Baelish. She convinced her new husband to give Petyr the customs for Gulltown around 289 AC, where Petyr performed so well that Arryn eventually brought him to court, eventually rising to the position of master of coin. During this time, Lysa and Petyr begin a secret affair.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near the start of A Game of Thrones Lysa's husband, Jon, had grown concerned about how weak his son was and arranged for the boy to be fostered with Lord Stannis Baratheon on Dragonstone. Lysa was furious upon learning about this arrangement,[36] and as per Petyr's instructions, poisons Jon with the Tears of Lys, making his death appear natural. After Jon's abrupt death, King Robert attempted to arrange for Lysa's son Robert to become a ward of Lord Tywin Lannister at Casterly Rock, as he feared that being raised by his mother would make his namesake weak. However, Lysa refused the suggestion brusquely and, against the wishes of the king, fled with her son from King's Landing back to the Vale of Arryn, without bidding farewell.
