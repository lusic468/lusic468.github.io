              <b>PRINCE TOMMEN BARATHEON</b> is known to the Seven Kingdoms as the youngest child of King Robert I Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister. A member of House Baratheon of King's Landing, his siblings are Prince Joffrey and Princess Myrcella.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tommen once adopted a fawn as a pet but his elder brother, Prince Joffrey, later killed and skinned the animal. It is also implied Joffrey bullies and abuses Tommen physically. Following the tourney on Prince Joffrey's name day, Tommen and his siblings traveled with Cersei to Casterly Rock with their grandfather, Lord Tywin Lannister.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Tommen is part of the entourage of his father, King Robert I Baratheon, which journeys to Winterfell following the death of Lord Jon Arryn. At Winterfell Tommen spars with Bran Stark using wooden swords.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tommen and Myrcella do not recognize a dirty Arya Stark when she chases cats in King's Landing. Arya bowls over Tommen when she escapes from House Lannister guards.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Eddard Stark, the new Hand of the King, discovers that Tommen and his siblings are not the biological children of Robert, but actually Cersei's twin brother, Ser Jaime Lannister. With Robert dying from being gored by a boar, Lord Renly Baratheon suggests that Tommen and Myrcella be seized and that Arya wed Tommen. Eddard refuses, however.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tommen's older brother, Prince Joffrey, becomes king after Robert dies. Tommen is present when Eddard is arrested in the throne room.
