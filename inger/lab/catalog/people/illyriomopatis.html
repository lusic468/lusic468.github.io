              <b>ILLYRIO MOPATIS IS</b> a wealthy and powerful magister in the Free City of Pentos. He is a dealer in spices, gemstones, dragonbone, and other things, including slaves. For a time he served as custodian of the exiled Targaryens and now seeks to return them to the Iron Throne.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a young man, Illyrio was a poor bravo, living by his blade. After the young Varys arrived in Pentos they formed an unlikely friendship and worked together and became very rich. Illyrio grew very respectable and married the maiden daughter of a cousin of the Prince of Pentos - only with the help of Varys did he reach a position where the daughter of a magister was willing to marry him. After she died, he remarried at least once, to Serra, a Lysene pillow house worker. This infuriated the prince, who barred the palace to him forever after. Illyrio was happy with Serra until the Treasure, a Braavosi trading galley carrying the plague, anchored in Pentos. Through the rats the plague left the ship and killed two thousand in the city, among them Serra. Illyrio keeps a locket with Serra's picture and her hands as a reminder of his lost love.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even decades after Varys left to serve in Westeros the two still keep in close contact.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illyrio has kept an eye on the remaining Targaryens, Viserys and Daenerys, for years whilst they lived in exile in the Free Cities. Eventually, he took them into his manse, keeping them under his protection. The children stayed half a year before Dany's marriage to Khal Drogo. He was smitten at first by the beauty of Daenerys and thought of eliminating Viserys and claiming her as a wife, but dismissed this idea soon as he believed the girl too timid and frightened and that coupling with her would give him no pleasure. He claims he protected Viserys and Daenerys on the grounds that Viserys promised to make him the master of coin upon his ascension to the Iron Throne.
