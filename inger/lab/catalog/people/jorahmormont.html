              <b>SER JORAH MORMONT</b> is an exiled knight, the former head of House Mormont and Lord of Bear Island. He fled Westeros to escape execution for trading in slaves and took up work as a mercenary in the Free Cities, eventually entering the service of the last Targaryens. He becomes one of the most trusted companions of Daenerys Targaryen.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jorah was married at a young age to a girl from House Glover as his father, Lord Jeor Mormont, desired. While they were married for ten years, Jorah's wife was unable to carry a child to term. She eventually died following her third miscarriage. Presumably prior to Robert's Rebellion, Jorah's father Jeor had given up the lordship of House Mormont by joining the Night's Watch, which made Jorah the Lord of Bear Island in his own right. During Robert's Rebellion, Jorah fought on the side of the rebels, and was present during the Battle of the Trident in 283 AC.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the death of his first wife, Jorah received multiple marriage offers from other houses. Before he made his decision, however, Balon Greyjoy rose in rebellion. Jorah fought in this war as well, during which he distinguished himself by showing exemplary courage on the battlefield, being one of the first men through the breach during the siege of Pyke. He received a knighthood from King Robert I Baratheon in recognition of his bravery. According to Illyrio Mopatis, Jorah was anointed by the High Septon when he became a knight, though it is unknown which religion Jorah follows, nor even whether the High Septon was present on Pyke.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tourney was held at Lannisport to celebrate the victory over the Greyjoy rebels. There, Jorah met Lynesse Hightower, and was immediately smitten with her beauty. When Jorah asked for her favor to wear during the tournament, she gave her permission. Jorah fought remarkably well during the tourney, winning an improbable victory over all challengers. He faced Ser Jaime Lannister last, and after they broke nine lances to no result, King Robert I Baratheon granted Jorah the victory. Jorah named Lynesse his queen of love and beauty, and asked Lynesse's father, Lord Leyton Hightower, for her hand in marriage that same night. Surprisingly, Lord Leyton agreed. Jorah and Lynesse were married at Lannisport, after which they returned to Bear Island.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marriage did not remain happy for long. Having spent her entire life up to that point as part of wealthy House Hightower in the mild, prosperous and densely populated Reach, Lynesse was unprepared for life on the harsh and isolated Bear Island and quickly grew miserable. Jorah attempted to reproduce the lifestyle his wife was accustomed to by lavishing her with expensive gifts, but only succeeded in driving himself into financial ruin.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desperate to pay off his debts, Jorah resorted to breaking one of the Seven Kingdoms' oldest taboos: participating in the slave trade. When House Mormont's liege, Lord Eddard Stark, learned that Jorah had sold poachers to a Tyroshi slaver, he condemned him to the traditional penalty: death. However, when Eddard arrived on Bear Island to execute him, Jorah had already fled.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than join his father in taking the black, Jorah took Lynesse with him into exile. While Jorah wanted to go to Braavos, Lynesse wanted a warmer home, so they fled to Lys instead, where Jorah sold his ship. Within half a year, however, they had no money left anymore, so Jorah sold his service as a sellsword. However, while Jorah was fighting the Braavosi on the Rhoyne, Lynesse took Tregar Ormollen as her lover, and moved into his manse. When Jorah returned to Lys, Ormollen informed him that he would be enslaved for his debts, unless he gave up Lynesse and left Lys. Heartbroken, Jorah went to Volantis, where he spent the better part of a year. He remained near the Free Cities travelling as far east as Vaes Dothrak, an, having spend time with the Dothraki, eventually came to speak their language and learn their customs.
