            <b>AEMON, BORN AEMON</b> Targaryen, is the third son of King Maekar I Targaryen and his wife Dyanna Dayne. He has served as a maester to the Night's Watch at Castle Black for so long that the rest of the Seven Kingdoms has forgotten about his Targaryen blood.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aemon Targaryen was the third son of King Maekar I Targaryen and his wife, Lady Dyanna Dayne. He was named after his great-great-uncle, Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, by his grandfather, Daeron II Targaryen. At this time, King Daeron II had four grown sons, three with sons of their own, and so felt that having too many potential Targaryen heirs was dangerous and sent Aemon to the Citadel around the age of nine or ten. At one point after his younger brother, Aegon V, became the squire of the hedge knight Duncan the Tall the pair visited Aemon in Oldtown. Aemon measured Duncan's height.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aemon forged his chain, and earned the title of Maester Aemon, finishing his studies at the age of nineteen. He served an unidentified lord until his father, now King Maekar I, summoned him to court to serve the Iron Throne. Not wanting to sit on the small council as he felt that would displace the Grand Maester, Aemon chose instead to serve at Dragonstone, the seat of his eldest brother, Prince Daeron, until Daeron died of the pox. After Daeron's death, Maester Aemon became a maester at the Citadel. He was summoned to court for the Great Council of 233 AC, where some wanted to offer him the crown. Aemon quietly refused, however, ceding rule to his younger brother, Aegon V. Rhaelle, Aegon's young daughter, referred to Aemon as "Uncle Maester".<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aemon then chose to go to the Wall to take the vows of the Night's Watch for fear that he may be used in a plot to usurp his brother. On his journey King Aegon provided him with an "honor guard" (emptying the dungeons) to take the vows of the Night's Watch with him. Among them was Brynden Rivers, who later went on to become Lord Commander of the Watch. Ser Duncan accompanied them aboard the Golden Dragon on the way to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhaegar Targaryen sometimes corresponded with his ancient great-great uncle via raven messages. Aemon claims that every man who has ever joined the Watch has been tested on keeping his vows at least once. Aemon stated that he was tested three times, and that the hardest time for him was hearing about the destruction of House Targaryen during the War of the Usurper.</p>
