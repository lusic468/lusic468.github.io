              <b>PRINCESS DAENERYS TARGARYEN</b>, also known as Daenerys Stormborn, is one of the last confirmed members of House Targaryen, along with her older brother Viserys, who refers to her as Dany. She is the youngest child of King Aerys II Targaryen and his sister-wife, Queen Rhaella.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young woman in her early teens, Daenerys has the classical Valyrian look; She has violet eyes, pale skin, and long, pale silver-gold hair. Daenerys is slender of frame, with small breasts. She is said to bear a certain physical resemblance to Queen Naerys Targaryen, though Daenerys is taller. Daenerys has been described as fair, and beautiful. She is fond of heath.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the Common Tongue, Daenerys speaks the bastard Valyrian of the Free Cities with a Tyroshi accent, as well as High Valyrian. She is quick to learn the Dothraki language, as well as the Ghiscari tongue.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daenerys grew up terrified and abused by her brother Viserys, and was regarded as fearful and furtive by magister Illyrio Mopatis. Following her marriage to the Dothraki Khal Drogo, Daenerys grows more confident, which puts her at odds with Viserys, who is having trouble adapting to the Dothraki style of life. She dares to punish him when he threatens her, and later also hits him. Following Drogo's death, she assumes command of her own small khalasar. Despite her successful conquests and growing support, she remains troubled with doubts. However, her followers generally regard her with great respect and love, and Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy have compared her to her deceased brother Rhaegar, who had been valiant, honorable, and noble, and is still fondly remembered in the Seven Kingdoms.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she was raised in exile, never staying long as one place, Daenerys has never truly known a place to call home. Though she describes the fragrants of the Western Market at Vaes Dothrak with smelling "of home", they in fact remind of her her days spent in several of the Free Cities as a small child. Among the Dothraki, she feels safe, loved and hopefull for the first time. The house with the red door in Braavos, where she lived until she was about five years old, has come to symbolize her lost childhood, and she frequently wishes to return there. Though she has never seen Westeros and cannot remember Dragonstone, she believes that the Iron Throne is her by rights, as Viserys's heir, and that ruling the Seven Kingdoms is her duty. Daenerys wishes to rule with justice, but is nonetheless able to deal ruthlessly with her enemies (as seen in both Astapor and Meereen). Daenerys abhors slavery, and makes it her priority to stop the slave trade. Because of this, she is especially loved by the former slaves, but disliked by the nobility of the eastern cities. Daenerys is willing to put the needs of her people before her own desires[24]<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daenerys loves the sea, as it makes her feel free, as well as the sailors and their songs and stories. She also loves to read children’s stories and songs from the Seven Kingdoms about hall and handsome heroes.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Descendent of dragonlords, Daenerys dreams of dragons several times before she hatches three dragon eggs. She lends strength from the second dream. After the birth of her three Dragons, Daenerys develops a bond with them, especially Drogon, whom she eventually claims as a mount.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During her time with the Dothraki, Daenerys dressed in Dothraki garb; a painted vest and riding leathers, while going about barefoot, with her hair oiled and her skin sun-browned. She wears Dothraki clothing — sandsilk or horsehair pants, woven grass sandals, a medallion belt and her vest — frequently until she reaches Meereen. Though at first she continues to wear Dothraki clothing whilst in the slaver city when she is alone, she starts wearing a tokar, traditional Ghiscari clothing, when she assumes the rule of Meereen. During her time in Qarth, Daenerys dresses in the Qartheen fashion, a gown which leaves one breast bare. Daenerys also frequently wears a cloak made of the skin of a Hrakkar which Drogo had slain, which reminds her of him, making her feel as if he is near.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though Daenerys is familiar with the Faith of the Seven, and believes in the existence of gods, she does not appear to follow a particular faith.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daenerys is the youngest child of King Aerys II Targaryen and his sister-wife, Queen Rhaella. Daenerys was conceived during the last month of Robert's Rebellion, the war which ended House Targaryen's reign over the Seven Kingdoms. Shortly thereafter, her mother was sent with the young prince Viserys to the family ancestral seat of Dragonstone to escape the rebel army which was marching towards King's Landing. Daenerys was born nine months after their flight, while a great storm raged above Dragonstone, sinking what remained of the Targaryen fleet; for this reason she is known as "Daenerys Stormborn". Her mother died in labor, but not before naming her.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war had been lost shortly after Rhaella had fled the city, after which Robert I Baratheon had claimed the throne. With Aerys, his eldest son Rhaegar, and Rhaegar's young children Rhaenys and Aegon dead, Daenerys and her older brother Viserys were the only known living Targaryen heirs. As Viserys had been crowned king on Dragonstone by their mother before her death, Daenerys received the title "Princess of Dragonstone" as Viserys's heir. Robert's brother, Stannis, had built a new fleet for the Baratheon's, and was planning to assault Dragonstone. With the Targaryen fleet destroyed by the storm during which Daenerys had been born, the garrison at Dragonstone planned to sell the Targaryen children to Robert. However, before they could act on this plan, Ser Willem Darry and several other loyal retainers rescued the children and smuggled them into exile, sailing to the Free City of Braavos. There, they lived for years in a house with a red door, where Daenerys had her own room, and a lemon tree underneath her window. Willem was old and sickly, but Daenerys remembers that he always treated her kindly. When Daenerys was five years old, Willem fell sick and slowly wasted away. After his death, the servants he had hired stole all they could. The young Targaryens were put out of the house a while after. As they were forced out, Daenerys wept.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viserys and Daenerys left Braavos, and wandered the Free Cities for years. They visited nearly all the Free Cities, including Myr, Tyrosh, Qohor, Volantis, and Lys, and returned to Braavos at least once. While at first they were welcomed by magisters and archons and merchant princes, with time doors their interests in the last Targaryens decreased. Daenerys and Viserys had to sell their last few treasures, and eventually their mother's crown. Selling their mother's crown took the last of Viserys's joy, leaving only rage. Daenerys remembers how Viserys once feasted the Golden Company, hoping they would take up his cause, but to on avail. Considering himself to be the rightful ruler, Viserys grew bitter and obsessed with the birthright he had been denied. Daenerys was a frequent target for his frustrations. He had never forgiven her for their mother's death in childbirth, and frequently warned her not to "wake the dragon" by angering him. Once, when Daenerys and Viserys were on their way to Braavos by ship, Daenerys expressed to her brother how fine it would be to be a sailor. Angry, Viserys twisted her hair until she cried. Because Viserys had often told her that their line must be "kept pure", Daenerys had grown up always believing that she would marry Viserys once she came of age.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though Viserys's growing bitterness made their relationship more troubled, Daenerys also has fond memories of her brother from times when he had not yet been so angry. He let her crawl into bed with him and told her stories about the Seven Kingdoms, about their family and their history, their dragons, and Robert's Rebellion. Almost everything Daenerys knew about Westeros she learned from Viserys, making her feel as if she knew what it was like without ever having been there. Viserys was intent on reclaiming their father's throne, and promised Daenerys a thousand times that he would take her back to Westeros, and that their lives would be much better once he had. Viserys also told her about siege towers, and the Faith of the Seven.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 297 AC, Viserys and Daenerys were taken in by magister Illyrio Mopatis in the Free City of Pentos, who offered his help in reclaiming the Iron Throne for Viserys. They lived with Illyrio for almost half a year.
