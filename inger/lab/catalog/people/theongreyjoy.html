              <b>THEON GREYJOY IS</b> a member of House Greyjoy and is the sole surviving son and heir apparent of Lord Balon Greyjoy. At the end of Greyjoy's Rebellion, Theon was taken as a hostage and ward to Lord Eddard Stark.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theon is a lean, dark, handsome youth who seems to find everything amusing. He is known for his confidence and his cocky smile. He is promiscuous and vain, but behind his arrogant exterior hides insecurities relating to his uncertain familial and social identity. Theon seeks approval from the Starks, but usually feels unsatisfied. The youth is not particularly religious.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theon refers to Theon Stark, a King in the North, as his namesake. Theon received beatings at Pyke from his older brothers, Rodrik and Maron.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theon was a boy of ten when Greyjoy's Rebellion was crushed and his brothers were killed, making him the heir to House Greyjoy and the Iron Islands. Theon was taken from his father, Lord Balon Greyjoy, as a hostage and ward by Lord Eddard Stark and has been raised at Winterfell for nine years since.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theon was raised with the Stark children and tutored with them in all disciplines, including instruction from Maester Luwin and training from Ser Rodrik Cassel. His relationship with the Starks is respectful, considering Robb a close friend and younger brother. Theon ignores the sullen Jon Snow, the other outsider of the family. However, though he claims to Catelyn Stark that Lord Eddard was like a second father to him, and Eddard indeed attempted to be like a father to him from time to time, Theon still thought Eddard to be cold. As a child, Theon used to think that Eddard might marry him to his eldest daughter Sansa and claim him for a son.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theon and Robb trained with wooden swords on the steps of Winterfell, and together with Jon Snow were trained at arms by Ser Rodrik Cassel. He played in the castle's godswood, and participated in melees during tourneys. In 296 AC Theon traveled with Lord Eddard to Torrhen's Square, where he spent a fortnight with Benfred Tallhart, whom Theon teased for his large neck.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theon has slept with numerous women, including Kyra and Bessa of the winter town and a miller's wife along the Acorn Water. He lost his virginity in Winterfell's godswood.
