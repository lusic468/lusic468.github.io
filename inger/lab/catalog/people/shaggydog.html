              <b>SHAGGYDOG IS THE</b> direwolf belonging to Rickon Stark. Rickon is known to shorten his name to Shaggy. He is the litter-mate of Grey Wind, Summer, Lady, Nymeria and Ghost.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Shaggydog is found in the snow with his brothers and sisters by Robb Stark and Jon Snow. They are taken back to the castle where Shaggydog is chosen by Rickon. After Bran's fall, Shaggydog would often join Summer and Grey Wind in howling beneath Bran's window. During Tyrion Lannister's return to Winterfell, Rickon arrived with the direwolves, Summer, Grey Wind and Shaggydog in tow. When they caught the scent of Tyrion, all three direwolves moved in to corner him and Tyrion was only saved when the Starks called off their wolves. Once Rickon discovers that Robb may be going off to war, he becomes angry and Shaggydog begins to take after his master, biting Gage and Mikken. Farlen chained Shaggydog up so he would bite no one else and Rickon became even more upset.
