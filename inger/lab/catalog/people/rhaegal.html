              <b>RHAEGAL IS ONE</b> of the dragons born on the Dothraki Sea, along with Drogon and Viserion. Commanded by Daenerys Targaryen, he was named for her brother, Rhaegar Targaryen.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhaegal has green and bronze scales. His green scales are a dark green, the green of moss in the deep woods at dusk, just before the light fades, and they gleam like jade. His teeth and claws are black. His eyes are bronze, brighter than polished shields, and they glow with their own heat. His flame is orange-and-yellow fire shot through with veins of green.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhaegal's egg is a deep green, with burnished bronze flecks that comes and goes depending on how Daenerys turns it. The maegi Mirri Maz Duur proclaims that in order to bring new life one had to give life. Daenerys burns Drogo's body, along with Mirri Maz Duur herself and the three eggs to give birth to Rhaegal, along with his brothers, Viserion and Drogon.
