              <b>BENJEN STARK, ALSO</b> known as Ben Stark, is the younger brother of Lord Eddard Stark and First Ranger of the Night's Watch.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjen was the youngest child of Lord Rickard Stark and Lady Lyarra Stark. He attended the tourney at Harrenhal with his siblings, Brandon, Eddard, and Lyanna, in 281 AC. At the tournament Lyanna rescued their father's vassal, Howland Reed, from an attack by three squires. Benjen offered Howland a horse and some armor so he could challenge his attackers. During the feast held to celebrate the start of the tournament, he teased Lyanna when she cried for a sad and beautiful song by the noted musician, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. Lyanna poured wine over his head for tesing him. When a black brother from the Night's Watch spoke up during the feast, attempting to convince the gathered people to join the black brothers, Benjen took the plea to heart.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time Benjen got well and truly drunk, he was younger than fourteen.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjen was the Stark in Winterfell during Robert's Rebellion. Although House Stark had been reduced to Benjen, Eddard, Eddard's infant son Robb, and Eddard's infant bastard son Jon Snow due to the events of the war, Benjen joined the Night's Watch within a few months of Eddard's return north. His reasons for doing so are unknown. Benjen took his vows in front of a heart tree located half a league from Castle Black, north of the Wall. Benjen's skills served him well as a ranger, and he quickly rose to the position of First Ranger. Mance Rayder came to consider Benjen the bane of the free folk.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjen visited Winterfell on several occasions over the years. Once, Bran Stark recited all of the names of the castles build at the Wall for Benjen. Benjen and Eddard had discussed repopulating the Gift by raising new lords, so they could function as a shield against the wildlings. Benjen was convinced that Lord Commander Jeor Mormont could be convinced to part with the land, on the condition that taxes would be paid to Castle Black instead of Winterfell. Benjen also wrote Eddard, keeping him updated on (eg. the military strength of the Night's Watch). Benjen shares his brother Eddard's dislike for Lannisters.<br>
