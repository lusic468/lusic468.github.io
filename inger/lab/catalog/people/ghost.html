              <b>GHOST IS AN</b> albino direwolf bonded to Jon Snow. He receives his name from Jon because of his white fur and the fact that he never makes a sound. Ghost is the litter-mate of Grey Wind, Lady, Nymeria, Summer, and Shaggydog.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with his litter-mates, Ghost is discovered by the Stark children after his mother was killed by a stag. Ghost was the first pup to open his eyes and had wandered off unnoticed by the time the Starks arrived. Jon Snow convinces Eddard Stark to allow his children to keep the pups by noting that the five remaining pups match the five Stark children, excluding himself. Only afterwards does Jon hear Ghost nearby, the only one of the humans to do so. Theon Greyjoy wants to kill the albino pup, but Jon claims him.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghost accompanies Jon to the Wall and through his adventures with the Night's Watch. Ghost exhibits a great deal of intelligence, and frequently works to Jon's benefit with a surprising amount of insight for an animal. Ghost wakes Jon by scratching at his door one night, alerting Jon to the presence of wights, and they are able to save Lord Commander Jeor Mormont from the undead Othor. In gratitude, Jeor gifts Jon with the Valyrian steel sword Longclaw, having replaced the ruined bear's head pommel with that of a white wolf's head. When Jon deserts the Night's Watch, Ghost betrays their position so that Jon's friends can bring him back.<br>
