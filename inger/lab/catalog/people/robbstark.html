              <b>THE ELDEST STARK</b> son and thus heir to Ned Stark, Robb Stark, though just fourteen, is mature beyond his age as well as being brave and dutiful like his father.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robb was conceived during the first fortnight of the marriage of Lord Eddard Stark and Lady Catelyn Tully - on the wedding night, according to Catelyn. While Eddard rode south to fight in Robert's Rebellion, Catelyn remained at Riverrun while she was pregnant with Robb, which is where he was born, with Maester Luwin assisting with the birth. Robb was born near the end of the war, and after it ended Catelyn travelled to Winterfell with Robb.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robb was raised at Winterfell as his father's heir, and is the closest of companions with his half-brother Jon Snow. Robb and Jon trained together at arms ever since they were big enough to walk, and played at being mighty knights and heroes. Once, Robb and Jon built a great mountain of snow above a gate. They were spotted by a brother of the Night's Watch who had accompanied the visiting Lord Commander Qorgyle, who promised not to tell on them. The two boys eventually dumped the snow on Fat Tom, the slowest of Lord Eddard's household guards, who had chased them around afterward.  After Greyjoy's Rebellion in 289 AC, Eddard brought a hostage home, Theon Greyjoy. Over the years, Robb came to regard Theon and enjoy the elder boy's company. Theon joined Robb and Jon in their training at arms, and Robb and Theon trained at swordfighting at the staircases of Winterfell.
