              <b>ROBERT ARRYN, ALSO</b> known as Sweetrobin, is the only son of Lord Jon Arryn and Lady Lysa Tully. He is the new head of House Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie, Defender of the Vale, and Warden of the East. Robert is named after King Robert I Baratheon.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert is a sickly, whiny, and spoilt child of six. He is small and pale with brown hair and big eyes. His hair later grows very long.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert is afflicted with a disease that causes frequent seizures. Maester Colemon bleeds him frequently and often administers a painkiller during his fits that, if used continuously, has an increasing level of toxicity. He is intellectually and physically stunted, and is not weaned from his mother's breast.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Robert became Lord of the Vale upon the death of his father, Lord Jon Arryn, but does not receive his father's title of Warden of the East, as King Robert I Baratheon grants it instead to Ser Jaime Lannister. The court at the Eyrie instead refers to Robert Arryn as the True Warden of the East.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before his ascension, Lord Tywin Lannister offered to take young Robert as his ward, something he had never offered to anyone else. Eddard Stark suspects Tywin made this offer in order to seize Robert Arryn as a hostage. Robert Baratheon planned to accept the offer but Lady Lysa Arryn fled from King's Landing to the Vale with her son to avoid this.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert's mother, Lady Lysa, rules the Vale as regent in his name, but makes no effort to school him in the governance of his realm. He presides over the trial of Tyrion Lannister for the attempted murder of Bran Stark. He is upset when Bronn defeats Ser Vardis Egen in Tyrion's trial by combat as he wanted to "make him fly" through the Moon Door.
