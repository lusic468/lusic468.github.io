              <b>EDDARD STARK, ALSO</b> called "Ned", is the head of House Stark, Lord of Winterfell, and Warden of the North. He is a close friend to King Robert I Baratheon, with whom he was raised.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eddard Stark was born the second son of Lord Rickard Stark and Lady Lyarra Stark. He had one older brother, Brandon, and two younger siblings, Lyanna and Benjen.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eddard was fostered by Lord Jon Arryn at the Eyrie from the age of eight. There, Eddard befriended his fellow ward, Robert Baratheon, while Lord Jon became like a second father to him. When he reached the age of sixteen, Eddard was a man grown, and divided his time between Winterfell and the Eyrie. During one of his visits to Winterfell, Eddard carried a wedding proposal from Robert to his father, Lord Rickard, who agreed to betroth his daughter Lyanna to Eddard's friend. When Lyanna later expressed that her believe that Robert would never keep to one bed, having heard about Robert's bastard daughter in the Vale, Eddard recalled having seen the child, and is unable to deny her existence.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 281 AC, at the age of eighteen, Eddard came down from the Eyrie to go to the tourney at Harrenhal, where, amongst others, Eddard's foster brother Robert Baratheon, his foster father Jon Arryn, and his three siblings, Brandon, Lyanna and Benjen were also present. It was during this tourney that Eddard would meet Howland Reed, one of his father's bannermen. Howland and Eddard would remain friends for the rest of their lives. During the opening feast, Eddard saw Ashara Dayne, a lady-in-waiting to Princess Elia Martell. He would dance with her later that night, but only after his older brother Brandon had spoken to her on his behalf, since he himself was too shy. Eddard was present during the final jousts, where Prince Rhaegar Targaryen passed over his own wife, Elia, to crown Lyanna the queen of love and beauty. Eddard would remember this moment as "the moment when all smiles died" years later.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following year, Eddard's sister Lyanna was allegedly abducted by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. Eddard's brother Brandon rode to King's Landing in anger, but when he threatened the crown prince, he was arrested. Lord Rickard Stark was summoned to King's Landing, and when he demanded a trial by combat, both he and Brandon were executed at the command of King Aerys II Targaryen. Aerys's next step was to demand that Jon Arryn send him the heads of his former wards, Eddard and Robert. Jon refused and instead called his banners.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eddard returned home to Winterfell. He brought his bastard son, Jon Snow, with him. This strained the relationship with his wife Catelyn, who had given birth to their son Robb during the war. Eddard refused to speak to her about Jon's mother. However, stories concerning her identity circulated nonetheless. When Lady Catelyn heard rumors that the boy's mother was the Dornish noblewoman Ashara Dayne, she confronted Eddard about it, but he told her in a brusque manner that the child was his blood and that was all she needed to know. He subsequently silenced the rumors about Ashara. Sansa Stark recalls hearing whispers that Jon's mother was common born. Lord Edric Dayne believes that, rather than his aunt Ashara, Jon Snow's mother was a woman called Wylla, who worked for House Dayne and at one point served as Edric's wet-nurse. When asked about the mother of his bastard son by King Robert Baratheon, Eddard also mentions the name Wylla. However, Lord Godric Borrell claims that the daughter of the fisherman who sneaked Eddard away from the Fingers gave birth to Jon Snow.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a second son, Eddard had never expected to become the Lord of Winterfell, and as such did not always feel equal to the task, determined it had all been meant for his brother Brandon. He did not often leave the North. Although his bannermen were loyal, Eddard dealt with the problems that did arise swiftly. When Lord Jorah Mormont tried to sell poachers he had caught on his lands into slavery, Eddard travelled to Bear Island to bring him to justice for his crime, but, upon arrival, found that Mormont and his wife had fled into exile. In 289 AC, Eddard travelled south to fight alongside Robert once more, this time in the Greyjoy Rebellion. After the decisive Siege of Pyke and Balon Greyjoy's surrender, Eddard took Lord Balon's only surviving son Theon as a ward and hostage. While he would try to be like a father to Theon from time to time, Theon still thought Eddard to be cold.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During his marriage to Catelyn, he had five children with her: Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Rickon.
