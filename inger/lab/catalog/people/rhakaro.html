              <b>KING ROBERT I</b> Baratheon is the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the head of House Baratheon of King's Landing. Robert was crowned king after winning the rebellion which was named after him and taking the Iron Throne from King Aerys II Targaryen, his first cousin once removed. Robert fought the war to win back his betrothed, Lyanna Stark, with the aid of her brother, his close friend, Lord Eddard Stark. Due to Lyanna's death, however, Robert married Cersei Lannister after war's end to ensure political stability. Robert has three children with Cersei: Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert was once a renowned warrior with a good battlefield voice. In his youth he was described as very tall, broad shouldered and muscled like a maiden's fantasy. Eddard Stark estimates Robert's height at six feet and six inches, with his brothers slightly shorter. He kept himself clean shaven.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert's appearance began to change after winning the crown, however. He became overweight from excessive feasting and drinking. In the nine years since Greyjoy's Rebellion, he gained at least eight stone in weight. Robert grew a beard to hide his multiple chins.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert is an avid hunter who replaced the Targaryen dragon skulls in the throne room with hunting tapestries. Although the royal armory has numerous weapons, Tywin Lannister states the only blade used by Robert is a hunting knife he received from Lord Jon Arryn as a boy. In his younger days Robert wielded a spiked iron warhammer crafted by Donal Noye and a great antlered helmet with his armor.<br>
              As Rhaegar's second cousin, excluding Prince Viserys and Princess Daenerys, Robert was next in line for the Iron Throne via grandmother Rhaelle Targaryen, daughter of King Aegon V. This was a much stronger claim to the throne than the Arryns, Tullys or Starks.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Aerys and Rhaegar dead and King's Landing fallen, the lords of the Seven Kingdoms swore fealty to Robert and accepted him as king. He pardoned many of his former enemies and won some over as allies, naming Ser Barristan Selmy the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Those opposed to his reign, however, refer to Robert as the Usurper. Robert tasked Stannis with building a new royal fleet and capturing Dragonstone, the last Targaryen-loyalist stronghold. Although Stannis commanded the assault on Dragonstone, Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen were smuggled from the island beforehand, which angered the new king. Robert named Stannis Lord of Dragonstone and granted the Baratheons' ancestral seat of Storm's End to their young brother, Renly, which Stannis took as a slight.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorne never forgot or forgave the fact that Robert condoned the cold-blooded murders of Elia Martell and her children, Rhaenys and Aegon. Lord Jon Arryn managed to negotiate a truce with Dorne and a grudging acceptance of Robert's reign. Robert appointed Jon Arryn as his Hand of the King. Jon Arryn, along with Stannis, held the Seven Kingdoms together while Robert ate, drank, hunted, and whored.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert began his reign by marrying Cersei Lannister, Tywin's daughter, in 284 AC. It was a political match intended to bring stability to the kingdom. The marriage was not a happy one. During their wedding night Robert, while drunk, accidentally whispered, "Lyanna", an act that earned him his new wife's hatred. Cersei bore three children: Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen. In his unhappiness Robert took to drink, feasting and sleeping with other women.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six years after taking the crown, Robert and Eddard joined forces again to crush Greyjoy's Rebellion, which cemented Robert's position on the Iron Throne. Robert commanded during the siege of Pyke.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During his brother, Stannis's, wedding to Lady Selyse Florent, Robert deflowered Selyse's cousin, Delena Florent, on Stannis's wedding bed, though he claimed he was too drunk to know whose bed it was. This coupling led to the birth of Edric Storm, the only acknowledged bastard by Robert.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert beggared the realm with the expense of his tournaments and feasts, despite the fact Aerys II had left treasure vaults overflowing with gold. Robert's spending eventually left the crown in debt of over six million golden dragons (borrowing heavily from the Lannisters, the Tyrells, the Faith, and the Iron Bank of Braavos).<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to his frequent whoring, Robert also sired many bastards. Ser Justin Massey developed his lustiness while serving as Robert's squire; the king's current squires are Lancel and Tyrek Lannister, cousins of Queen Cersei. According to Donal Noye, Robert changed by becoming king, and not for the better. Robert also learned to close his eyes to anything he did not wish to see, a fact best proven when he was presented with the bodies of Rhaegar's children.
