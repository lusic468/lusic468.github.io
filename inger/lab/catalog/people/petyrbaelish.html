              <b>PETYR BAELISH, ALSO</b> called Littlefinger, is the head of House Baelish of the Fingers. He serves as master of coin on King Robert I Baratheon's small council. Petyr wears a mockingbird as his personal crest instead of House Baelish's sigil, a titan's head.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back at the Fingers, Petyr sent Catelyn a single letter after the death of her betrothed, Brandon. However, she burned the letter without reading it, and they would not see each other for many years to come. Catelyn married Eddard Stark during Robert's Rebellion, and went north to Winterfell after the conclusion of Robert's Rebellion. Petyr used to dream about Wintefell, always imagining it as a dark and cold place.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petyr did maintain a relationship with Lysa, even after her marriage to Lord Jon Arryn during Robert's Rebellion. Lysa convinced her husband to give Petyr control of customs at Gulltown around 289 AC, where he increased incomes tenfold, displaying his skill with finances. Jon Arryn, Hand of the King for King Robert I Baratheon, eventually brought Petyr to court in King's Landing, and within three years, he was named master of coin and appointed to the small council. There, he increased his influence by moving his own people in place, such as the four Keepers of the Keys, the King's Counter and the King's Scales, as well as harbor masters, toll collectors, and wine factors. Meanwhile, he also developed a complex web of loans, transactions, and investments, as to supply the King and the King's Hand with enough gold, and bought several establishments (including several brothels).<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During his time at court, Petyr continued his relationship with Lysa, who, as the wife to the Hand of the King, had been living in King's Landing as well. When Lysa learns that her husband plans to send their son, Robert Arryn, away to be fostered at Dragonstone by Lord Stannis Baratheon, it is Petyr who provides her with the poison she uses to kill Lord Jon. He also convinces her to send a message to her sister Catelyn at Winterfell, in which she accuses Queen Cersei Lannister and her family of the murder of her husband.<br>
