              <b>GREY WIND IS</b> a direwolf bonded to Robb Stark. He is the litter-mate of Lady, Nymeria, Summer, Shaggydog, and Ghost.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grey Wind has smoke grey fur and yellow eyes and is lean in stature. In <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Grey Wind is discovered along with his litter mates by Robb Stark and Jon Snow after the direwolves' mother has been killed by a stag. Like the other Stark direwolves, Grey Wind forms a special bond with his master. Like Robb, Grey Wind grows bold and faithful. Robb names him Grey Wind due to his fast speed when running. During Tyrion Lannister's return to Winterfell, Rickon Stark arrives with the direwolves Summer, Grey Wind, and Shaggydog in tow. When they catch the scent of Tyrion, all three direwolves move in to corner him and Tyrion is only saved when the Starks call off their wolves.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During Bran Stark's first ride on a horse since his fall, Robb, Grey Wind, and Summer go off in search of deer, leaving Bran alone. A small party of wildlings come upon Bran and promptly try to rob him. Robb, Grey Wind, and Summer return and a fight ensues. Grey Wind kills Wallen and then runs down another of the wildlings. All of the wildlings are killed except for Osha, who surrenders and is taken captive for further questioning.
