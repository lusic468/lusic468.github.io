              <b>SANDOR CLEGANE IS</b> a member of House Clegane. He is the younger brother of the current head, Ser Gregor Clegane. He is nicknamed the Hound for his fierce nature and unquestioning obedience to his masters and for the three dogs featured in his family's arms. The Hound is considered one of the most dangerous fighters in Westeros. As a child, Sandor received gruesome facial burns when Gregor shoved his face into a brazier. He came to loathe fire, his brother, and the hypocrisy of knighthood in general.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandor is a huge and heavily-muscled man. The left side of his face is gaunt, with sharp cheekbones and a heavy brow, while the right side is a burned ruin with a stump for an ear. Slick black flesh is pocked with craters and deep cracks that ooze red and wet. The scars extend down to his throat. There is a twisted mass of scar around his right eye, which is still good. Sandor's nose is large and hooked, and his long hair is dark and thin and brushed so that it covers the right since no hair grows there. Sandor's eyes are grey and bone shows on his jaw.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandor's childhood appears to have been overshadowed by his older brother Gregor's brutality and martial prowess. When Sandor was seven, his father explained the burns inflicted by Gregor by claiming his bedding caught fire. There are rumors of a sister who died young in mysterious circumstances, and their father was killed in a hunting accident shortly after King Robert I Baratheon came to the throne, which is also implied to have been suspicious, leaving the family estates to Gregor.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandor left to join the Lannister household the same day Gregor came into his inheritance. He claims to have killed a man when he was twelve years old, possibly during Robert's Rebellion, as he was part of Tywin Lannister's host during the Sack of King's Landing. Sandor has never taken a knight's vows.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ser Barristan Selmy unhorsed Sandor during a tourney a year ago.
