              <b>THE OTHERS, ALSO</b> known as white walkers, are a species of humanoid beings that exist in the north beyond the Wall. At the start of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, the Others have supposedly not been seen for eight thousand years.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to legend, the Others first appeared approximately eight thousand years before the War of Conquest, during a winter that lasted a generation and a period of darkness known as the Long Night. Eventually they were defeated, supposedly by the Night's Watch in the Battle for the Dawn, and the Wall may have been raised as a defense against them.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Night's King appears to have married a white walker, but the Others have not been heard of again since his defeat. They are regarded south of the Wall as nothing more than fairy tales to frighten the little children. They are often mentioned in curses, such as "The Others take his eyes."<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, during a ranging beyond the Wall, Ser Waymar Royce is slain by Others. He then rises as a wight and kills Will. Gared is able to escape and flee south of the Wall, but he is executed for desertion by Lord Eddard Stark.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, in conversation with Tyrion Lannister at Castle Black, refers to white walkers being glimpsed by fisherfolk on the shore near Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, with little concern. He does not say whether they were glimpsed on the shore north of the Wall or the shore south of it. Tyrion, unable to hold his tongue at the mention of white walkers, replies that fisherfolk of Lannisport often glimpse merlings. The conversation then moves to the movements of the wildlings which they consider a more pressing concern.
