              <b>PRINCESS MYRCELLA BARATHEON</b> is known to the Seven Kingdoms as the middle child of King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister. A member of House Baratheon of King's Landing, her siblings are Princes Joffrey and Tommen. Myrcella has golden curls, emerald eyes, and full lips. She is described by her uncle, Tyrion Lannister, as having all of her mother Cersei's beauty, but none of her mother's nature. Myrcella is delicate, beautiful, and courteous. For her age, she displays courage, a strong will, and high intelligence. She is eight, or almost eight, at the beginning of A Song of Ice and Fire. Myrcella resembles Rosamund Lannister.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Princess Myrcella accompanies her father, King Robert Baratheon, north to visit Winterfell and the Starks. She is smitten with Robb Stark during the feast. She rides in the royal wheelhouse with her mother, Queen Cersei Lannister.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myrcella and Tommen do not recognize a dirty Arya Stark when she chases cats in King's Landing.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Eddard Stark, the new Hand of the King, discovers that Myrcella and her siblings are not the biological children of Robert, but actually Cersei's twin brother, Ser Jaime Lannister. With Robert dying from being gored by a boar, Lord Renly Baratheon suggests that Tommen and Myrcella be seized and that Robb wed Myrcella. Eddard refuses, however.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Robert's death, Myrcella is in the throne room when Eddard confronts Cersei and is betrayed by Lord Petyr Baelish.
