              <b>SER ILYN PAYNE</b> is a knight from House Payne. He serves as the King's Justice, the royal executioner, for King Robert I Baratheon. Ilyn is a cousin to Podrick Payne.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilyn is a grim man, thin, with a beardless, pockmarked face. He has a deep set of pale, colorless eyes and hollow cheeks. He is almost completely bald. He wears iron-grey chainmail over boiled leather with a large greatsword worn over his right shoulder.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been mentioned more than once in the story that Ilyn lives for nothing but killing. Due to his appearance as well as his silence, many characters find him terrifying, a suitable trait for the King's Justice.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Ilyn keeps his weaponry immaculate, his chambers within the Red Keep's dungeon are poorly kept. Since he cannot read or write, he delegates to underlings, such as Rennifer Longwaters.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ser Ilyn was the commander of Lord Tywin Lannister's guard when he was Hand of the King for King Aerys II Targaryen. He was heard saying that it was Tywin who truly ruled the Seven Kingdoms, rather than Aerys. The king had Ilyn's tongue torn out with hot pincers for the comment.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilyn was named as the King's Justice by King Robert I Baratheon as a wedding present for Tywin. It was a sinecure to compensate Ilyn for the tongue he lost in the service of House Lannister. Ilyn is an extremely skilled executioner. He has never botched an execution and seldom requires more than a single stroke to finish off his charges.
