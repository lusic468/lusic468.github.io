              <b>BRONN IS A</b> low-born sellsword of great skill and cunning. Bronn has a lean, wolfish appearance, with dark hair, dark eyes and a stubble of beard. He has a black sense of humor, and a pragmatic, thoroughly amoral philosophy. Bronn supposedly had a rough childhood and killed for the first time before the age of twelve.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em> A Game of Thrones</em>, Bronn, along with his fellow sellsword Chiggen, is a patron of the inn in which Catelyn Stark calls for loyal men to help her arrest Tyrion Lannister for the attempted murder of her son, Bran Stark. Bronn and Chiggen heed Catelyn's call and help escort Tyrion to the Eyrie. During the journey Bronn survives an attack on their party by members of a clan of the Mountains of the Moon and becomes closer to Tyrion, to Catelyn's unease.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tyrion notes that Bronn and Chiggen only came to Catelyn's aid because they were sellswords and were hoping for a reward. During a later ambush, Chiggen is mortally wounded and Bronn discreetly finishes him off, claiming to Lady Catelyn that Chiggen died from his wounds.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During Tyrion's trial, Bronn volunteers to champion him in trial by combat and kills Ser Vardis Egen, saving Tyrion's life. He does so for the promise of wealth and makes no secret of his motives. Thereafter he enters into Tyrion's service as a hired sword.[2] Prior to the battle on the Green Fork he finds Shae for Tyrion amongst the camp followers and later takes part in the battle. When Tywin Lannister sends Tyrion to King's Landing, Bronn accompanies him.<br>
