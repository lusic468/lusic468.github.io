              <b>SUMMER IS THE</b> direwolf bonded to Bran Stark. He is the litter-mate of Grey Wind, Lady, Nymeria, Shaggydog and Ghost.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Summer is found with his litter-mates in the snow near their dead mother by Jon Snow and Robb Stark. Bran has difficulty choosing a name for his new direwolf pup, going through a thousand names without settling on one. After Bran's fall, Summer spends every moment he can howling beneath his window. Even when chased away, Summer returns and continues howling. An intruder enters Bran's room with the intent to kill him. Summer sneaks behind the man while he is occupied with Catelyn Tully and attacks him, tearing out his throat, ending the attack. When Bran awakes from his coma-like state, he gives a name to his wolf, Summer.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During Tyrion Lannister's return to Winterfell, Rickon arrives with the direwolves Summer, Grey Wind and Shaggydog in tow. When they catch the scent of the Tyrion, all three direwolves move to corner him and Tyrion is only saved when the Starks call off their wolves. During Bran's first ride on a horse since his fall, Robb, Grey Wind and Summer go in search of deer, leaving Bran alone. A small party of wildlings come upon Bran and promptly try to rob him. Robb, Grey Wind and Summer return and a fight ensues. Summer kills Hali, taking a knife wound in the process. All of the wildlings are killed except for Osha, who surrenders and is taken captive for further questioning.
