              <b>PRINCE VISERYS TARGARYEN</b> is the heir of his father, King Aerys II Targaryen, following the death of his older brother, Prince Rhaegar, during Robert's Rebellion. The war turned Viserys and his younger sister, Daenerys, Princess of Dragonstone, into exiles from the Seven Kingdoms who can only plot to regain control of the Iron Throne.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He styles himself as "Viserys of the House Targaryen, the Third of His Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm", as he had been declared King Viserys III Targaryen by his mother Rhaella Targaryen on Dragonstone early in his exile. To the rest of the world Viserys is known as "the Beggar King".<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viserys and Daenerys lived under Ser Willem Darry's protection in a house with a red door in Braavos. While they lived in Braavos, Willem signed a secret marriage pact with Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne, with the Sealord of Braavos as a witness, agreeing that Viserys would take Princess Arianne Martell, daughter to Doran Martell, the Prince of Dorne, as his bride in exchange for Dorne supporting his claim for the throne. However, Viserys was never made aware of this pact, as he was an immature child when it was decided, and he was not ready for the information. Willem fell ill five years after fleeing from Dragonstone, however, and eventually died.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Willem's death, the servants stole what little money the children had, leaving Viserys and his sister impoverished. They were put out of the house in Braavos soon after. Viserys and Daenerys began to wander the Free Cities as guests of powerful citizens. From Braavos, they went to Myr, next to Tyrosh, on to Qohor, Volantis, and Lys, never staying long at one location. Viserys was convinced they were being followed by the hired knives of the Usurper, King Robert I Baratheon. While originally they were welcomed into the homes of the powerful citizens of the Free Cities, their welcome eventually faded, and they were forced to sell off their last possessions to survive. Selling Rhaella's crown took the last joy had from Viserys, leaving only rage. Over time, men started calling him the Beggar King. At some point Viserys feasted the captains of the Golden Company, in hopes they might take up his cause and restore him to the throne of Westeros. They ate his food and heard his pleas, but only laughed at him.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While his relationship with his sister was initially warm, Viserys grew to resent Daenerys for the death of their mother during her birth, and began treating her abusively, both with cruel words and with physical assaults. He would frequently warn her not to "wake the dragon" and incite his anger. Viserys taught Daenerys all he knew of Westeros history and the history of House Targaryen, teaching her to take pride in her family heritage, though sometimes abusively. Daenerys always expected she would marry Viserys when she came of age, as Viserys had often told her the line must be kept pure and that Targaryens did not mingle their blood with that of lesser men.
