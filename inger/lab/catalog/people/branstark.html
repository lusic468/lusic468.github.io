              <b>TYPICALLY CALLED BRAN,</b> Brandon Stark is the second son of Lord Eddard Stark and Lady Catelyn Tully. He is one of the major POV characters in the books. He has four older siblings—Robb, Jon, Sansa, Arya—and one younger—Rickon. Like his siblings, he is constantly accompanied by his direwolf, Summer, with whom he shares a strong warg connection. He is seven years old at the beginning.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born at Winterfell in 290 AC at the height of summer, Bran is the second son and fourth child of Catelyn Tully and Eddard Stark, head of House Stark. He is named after his late uncle, Eddard's elder brother Brandon, whose death was one of the major events that led to Robert's Rebellion in 282 AC.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bran has three older siblings (Robb, Sansa, and Arya) and one younger (Rickon). He also has a bastard half-brother, Jon Snow. As a child, Bran was educated by Maester Luwin and trained with weapons. Since he was a babe, Bran would often climb the walls of Winterfell, scaring Catelyn to death. Once, she pleaded for him to stop, and extracted a promise for him to do so, a promise which he kept for barely a fortnight. When Bran, wracked with guilt, confessed this to Eddard, he ordered his son to the Winterfell godswood, where Bran was eventually found asleep in the tallest sentinel tree. Ned then accepted his climbing, but told him to try to not let his lady mother see him.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bran dreams of becoming a knight and has asked to hear their stories over and over until their names have become "like music to him". He is enthralled especially by the ideals of the Kingsguard, but is disappointed to be informed by his father that the new Kingsguard's standards have been lowered.<br>
