            <b>JON SNOW IS</b> the bastard son of Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell. He has five half-siblings: Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Rickon Stark. Unaware of the identity of his mother,  Jon was raised at Winterfell. Jon eventually join's the Night's Watch, where he earns the nickname Lord Snow.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourteen-year-old Jon is said to have more Stark-like features than any of his half-brothers. He is graceful and quick, and has a lean build. Jon has the long face of the Starks, with dark, brown hair and grey eyes so dark they almost seem black. Because he looks so much like a Stark, Tyrion Lannister notes that whoever Jon's mother was, she left little of herself in her son's appearance. Out of all the Stark children, Arya Stark is said to resemble Jon the most, as Robb, Sansa, Bran and Rickon take after their Tully mother, Catelyn.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jon looks solemn and guarded, and is considered sullen and quick to sense a slight. Due to having been raised in a castle and trained by a master-at-arms, Jon is seen by some lower-born members of the Night's Watch as arrogant at first, though this changes when they become more friendly towards one another. Jon is observant, a trait he developed on account of being a bastard. He is a capable horseback rider and is well practiced in fighting with a sword. Jon has resented his bastard status most of the time. He desires to be viewed as honorable and wants to prove he can be as good and true as his half-brother, Robb. Jon dreamed he would one day lead men to glory, or even become a conqueror, as a child. He feels strongly about not fathering a bastard himself.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jon was born in 283 AC, near the end of Robert's Rebellion. Jon was named by Lord Eddard Stark.The identity of Jon Snow's mother remains a mystery, and several suggestions have been made by those who know the Starks. Jon is unaware of his mother's identity and Eddard refuses to speak of her. When Eddard returned from the war, he brought the newborn Jon to Winterfell, insisting on raising him with the rest of his family. Jon and his wet nurse had been installed in the castle before the arrival of Eddard's new wife, Catelyn Tully, and his young son and heir, Robb Stark, from Riverrun, which Catelyn did not take well.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Eddard Stark was fiercely protective of Jon and refused to send him away. Jon was raised at Winterfell with his half-siblings, where he was tutored by Maester Luwin, and trained at arms by the master-at-arms, Ser Rodrik Cassel. Jon has trained at swordplay since he was old enough to walk, together with Robb, whom he came to view as his "best friend, rival and constant companion", and later also with Theon Greyjoy, after the latter came to Winterfell following the conclusion of Greyjoy's Rebellion.</p>
