              <b>LADY IS A</b> direwolf bonded to Sansa Stark. She is the litter-mate of Grey Wind, Nymeria, Summer, Shaggydog, and Ghost.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Lady is discovered by Robb Stark and Jon Snow along with the rest of her litter after her mother was killed by a stag. Lady bonds with Sansa Stark and adopts her mistress's dainty manners and trusting nature.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Arya Stark's direwolf, Nymeria, attacks Prince Joffrey Baratheon along the banks of the Trident, Nymeria is ordered to be killed but she cannot be found. At Darry, the spiteful Queen Cersei Lannister orders Lady to be put down instead. In spite of Sansa's protests, her father Eddard Stark performs the execution himself, as is his custom and to spare Lady pain she might suffer if the royal executioner Ilyn Payne performs the deed. The trusting Lady does not sense Eddard's intention and is killed with a single blow of his greatsword, Ice. Eddard orders her body to be brought north and be buried in Winterfell. The guards are surprised by the order but Eddard states: "The Lannister woman shall never have this skin."<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady is buried in the lichyard at Winterfell. When she arrives, Grey Wind, Shaggydog, and Summer all sense her death and howl mournfully. According to George R. R. Martin, the loss of her wolf has left Sansa a little adrift.
