              <b>PYCELLE IS A</b> Grand Maester of the Citadel who has served in King's Landing and on the small council for over forty years.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pycelle forged his maester's chain during the reign of King Maekar I Targaryen. After Grand Maester Merion died on his way to serve Aegon V Targaryen, Pycelle was granted his position. He has been the Grand Maester of the Seven Kingdoms for forty years, serving Aegon V and Jaehaerys II Targaryen before Aerys II Targaryen. Pycelle wrote Observations Upon the Recent Blood-Letting on the Stepstones about the War of the Ninepenny Kings.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lord Tywin Lannister resigned his position as Aerys's Hand of the King and left court, the new focus of Aerys's mistrust became his own son and heir, Prince Rhaegar, who had become wary of his father's behavior. At court there was growing tension between the factions loyal to the king and those loyal to Rhaegar. It fell to Pycelle and the new Hand, Lord Owen Merryweather, the unenviable task of trying to keep the peace between the factions. Pycelle even dispatched a letter to the Citadel writing that tensions and division at court strongly resembled those before the Dance of the Dragons. Pycelle was fearful that a civil war between those loyal to the king and Rhaegar's supporters would break out unless some accord could be reached that would satisfy both factions.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite his oath to serve the realm, Pycelle has more loyalty to House Lannister. He convinced King Aerys to open his gates to his former Hand, Tywin, in the waning days of Robert's Rebellion, in the hope that Tywin would take the throne. This led to the Sack of King's Landing. The new king, Robert I Baratheon, pardoned Pycelle and allowed him to continue on the small council. Pycelle has generally promoted the interests of House Lannister on the council for years.
