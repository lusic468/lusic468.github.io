            <b>JEOR MORMONT, ALSO</b> known as the Old Bear, is the 997th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, which he commands from their headquarters, Castle Black. Jeor, previously head of House Mormont and Lord of Bear Island, abdicated his seat in favor of his son, Ser Jorah Mormont, and joined the Night's Watch.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presumably prior to Robert's Rebellion, Jeor abdicated his seat, leaving the lordship of Bear Island to his son, Ser Jorah Mormont, and joined the Night's Watch. He rapidly rose through the ranks and was elected Lord Commander in 288 AC. Jeor was deeply concerned by the declining power of the Watch and the rising threat of the wildlings beyond the Wall. On the advice of his First Ranger, Benjen Stark, he gave up the regular patrols used by his predecessor Lord Qorgyle in favor of a more random system, varying the number of patrols and the days of their departure, to make it more difficult for the wildlings to know their comings and goings. Sometimes a larger force was sent to garrison one of the abandoned castles for a fortnight or a moon's turn as well.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Jeor's son Jorah fled to the Free Cities to escape Lord Eddard Stark's punishment for selling captives into slavery, Jeor regained Longclaw, his house famous Valyrian steel blade, which his son left behind. Jeor's sister, Maege Mormont, became the head of House Mormont with the exile of Jorah.<br></p>
