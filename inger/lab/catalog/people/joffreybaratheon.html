              <b>PRINCE JOFFREY BARATHEON</b> is known to the Seven Kingdoms as the eldest son and heir of King Robert I Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister. A member of House Baratheon of King's Landing, his siblings are Princess Myrcella and Prince Tommen.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joffrey grew up as a spoiled and indulgent child with a cruel streak within him. His father, King Robert I Baratheon, is deeply disappointed with his son and feels little affection for Joffrey â€“ nor did he like the fact that Joffrey would always cry whenever Robert picked him up. It is implied that Joffrey craves Robert's respect and approval, and many of his acts are done in an effort to live up to his father's standards.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once after learning a kitchen cat was pregnant, Joffrey killed the animal and cut open its belly to see the kittens inside. He showed one of the unborn kittens to his father. Robert was so shocked and angry he hit the boy so hard it knocked out two of his baby teeth. Cersei also remarks that Robert would have beaten the boy if she had allowed it. It is also implied Joffrey bullied his younger brother, Tommen.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Cersei Lannister assigned Sandor Clegane to be her son's sworn sword. While Sandor is widely known as the Hound, Joffrey refers to his guardian as "dog".<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Joffrey's twelfth name day, King Robert organized a tourney in King's Landing in 298 AC, where, amongst others, Lord Walder Frey, Lord Jon Arryn, Lord Stannis Baratheon, and Ser Davos Seaworth were present. Following the tourney, Joffrey and his siblings traveled with Cersei to Casterly Rock with their grandfather, Lord Tywin Lannister.
