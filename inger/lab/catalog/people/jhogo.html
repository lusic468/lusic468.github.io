              <b>JHOGO IS A</b> Dothraki horserider of Daenerys Targaryen's khas who later becomes one of her bloodriders. Jhogo is very thin with a faint shadow of a mustache. He is fearless and quick to laugh.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Jhogo is one of four Dothraki warriors assigned to the khas of Daenerys Targaryen within the khalasar of Khal Drogo. When Viserys Targaryen attacks his sister in the Dothraki Sea, Jhogo uses his whip to separate them. He accompanies Daenerys during her visit to the Western Market in Vaes Dothrak. He helps stop an assassination attempt on Daenerys' life by a wineseller by ensnaring the man with his whip. He is given a tall, grey stallion by Drogo as a reward.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Daenerys intends to have Drogo healed using blood magic by Mirri Maz Duur, his bloodriders attempt to stop it. In the ensuing fight, Jhogo and Rakharo team up to kill Haggo.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Daenerys names Jhogo ko and asks him to become one of her bloodriders alongside Aggo and Rakharo, she offers him the silver-handled whip she received as a present during her wedding. He is at first reluctant, but he is the first of the three to accept after the dragons are born.
