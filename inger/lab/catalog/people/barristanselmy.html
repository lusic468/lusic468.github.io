              <b>SER BARRISTAN SELMY,</b> also called Barristan the Bold, is a knight from House Selmy and the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard of Robert I Baratheon. A celebrated hero, he has served in the Kingsguard since a time when these knights were still considered to be the greatest of the Seven Kingdoms.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barristan is tall and has blue eyes which some consider to be sad. He is an older man, with white hair and lined features. Some consider him handsome, at least for his age. Despite his advanced age, he looks strong and graceful and every bit the skilled knight he was in his youth. Like other members of the Kingsguard, his armor, cloak, and shield are all in white. His enameled scales have silver chasings and clasps.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 300 AC, Barristan becomes the Lord Commander of the Queensguard of Queen Daenerys Targaryen in Meereen. As a token of her esteem, Daenerys gifts Barristan with armor. The mail is gilded, finely wrought, the links as supple as good leather, the plate enameled, hard as ice and bright as new fallen snow. A dagger goes on one hip, his longsword on the other; it hangs from a white leather belt with golden buckles. He wears a long white cloak about his shoulders. The helm has a narrow eye slit and ornate dragon's wings, which are splendid to look upon.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barristan is considered one of the most skilled and respected knights in the Seven Kingdoms, considered to be made of the true steel that marks a Kingsguard knight. Bran Stark believes him to be the greatest living knight. However, according to Illyrio Mopatis, Barristan cannot be considered to be cunning.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barristan continued to serve in the Kingsguard when King Jaehaerys died, and Aerys II Targaryen ascended the throne. In 277 AC, during the Defiance of Duskendale, King Aerys had been held hostage inside of Duskendale for half a year. Lord Tywin Lannister, Hand of the King, was planning to storm the town, but Barristan offered to personally attempt to retrieve the captive King Aerys himself. Tywin gave him a day.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many songs were later made about Selmy's daring infiltration. Selmy disguised as a hooded beggar climbed the walls of Duskendale in the dead of night, walking through the town streets cloaked and hooded he approached the Walls of Dunfort, scaling the walls of the castle, and slaying a sentry before the man could raise the alarm. Selmy through stealth and courage found his way to the dungeons and freed Aerys and led him to the upper levels. During the escape attempt, Barristan slew two guards and Ser Symon Hollard, avenging the death of his sworn brother, Ser Gwayne Gaunt. He and the King rushed to the stables, Selmy slaying all those who tried to intervene as the alarm was being raised. Selmy and King Aerys mounted on stolen horses charged out the Dunfort gates before they could be barred and raced through the streets of Duskendale to the towns walls eventually escaping. Selmy, took an arrow to the chest during the rescue. After the defiance Ser Barristan pleaded for the life of the child Dontos Hollard as a boon, when House Hollard was destroyed for siding with the Darklyns in the Defiance, to which King Aerys acquiesced.<br>
