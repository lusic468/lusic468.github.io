              <b>SER JAIME LANNISTER</b>, also known as the Kingslayer, is a knight from House Lannister. He is the second child and first-born son of Lord Tywin Lannister of Casterly Rock and his wife, Lady Joanna, also of House Lannister. He is the twin brother of Queen Cersei Lannister. Raised at the age of fifteen to the Kingsguard of the Mad King, Aerys II Targaryen, Jaime became the youngest member in the history of the prestigious knightly order. He earned the derogatory nickname "Kingslayer" when he treasonously slew Aerys near the end of Robert's Rebellion.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As young children, Jaime and his sister Cersei looked so much alike, that not even their father was able to keep them apart. Jaime grew into a tall, handsome man, with curled hair the color of beaten gold. He has flashing cat-green eyes, and a smile that cuts like a knife. Jon Snow thinks to himself that Jaime is "what a king should look like", and Bran Stark feels that Jaime looks like "more like the knights in the stories".<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Kingsguard knight, Jaime wears a white armor and a white cloak. On occasion he wears golden armor decorated with the Lannister lion, with gilded longsword and ornate lion's helmet. He slew the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen while wearing his white cloak over his golden armor. Jaime alternatively wears a crimson silk tunic embroidered with a golden lion, along with black boots and a black cloak. He also wears crimson cloaks and a leather jack. Jaime wields a lance of golden wood.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jaime is a born warrior, with little interest in politics and court intrigue. He takes few things seriously. By his own admission, Jaime only feels truly alive when fighting or making love. He comes across as arrogant, amoral, and dishonorable. Because of the death of King Aerys, Jaime has earned such a bad reputation that everything he says is usually cast in the worst possible light. Jaime is rash, headstrong, and angers quickly. He is known to have little patience, and worries about the consequences of his actions only after committing the act. A great warrior,[26] Jaime inspires loyalty in his men. He is bold, and does not fear death.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the deaths of Brandon and Rickard Stark, Jon Arryn refused to obey Aerys II Targaryen's order to send the heads of Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon, starting a rebellion that would become known as Robert's Rebellion. After the Battle of the Bells, it became apparent to Aerys that Robert was a serious threat to the Targaryen rule. He devised a plan with the help of his chief pyromancers, which involved the placement of caches of wildfire all throughout the city. The plan was to burn the entire city to the ground rather than lose it to Robert. His new Hand, Lord Qarlton Chelsted, who had been elevated to the position after the exile of the previous Hand, Lord Jon Connington, following the Battle of the Bells, eventually confronted Aerys about his plan. Failing to convince Aerys to give up his plan, Chelsted resigned the office, flinging his chain of office to the floor. For that, Aerys burned him alive. As Aerys did not trust his newest addition to the Kingsguard, Jaime was kept close by, and therefore heard and saw it all.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerys grew aroused by burning people, and the night Chelsted was burned, Aerys visited the chambers of his wife. Jaime and his sworn brother, Ser Jonothor Darry, stood guard outside Queen Rhaella's bedchamber while Aerys raped her, listening to her cries. When Jaime, feeling conflicted, eventually commented to Jonothor that they were sworn to protect the queen as well, Jon replied, "but not from him."<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen left the Red Keep to face the rebels on the Trident. The day the prince left, Jaime begged Rhaegar to take him along, suggesting one of the other Kingsguard knights could remain at the king's side instead. Rhaegar refused the suggestion, admitting that King Aerys wanted to keep Jaime close as a hostage against his father, Lord Tywin. Rhaegar promised an angry and disappointed Jaime that changes would be made when he returned from the battlefield, and charged Jaime with keeping his wife and children safe.
