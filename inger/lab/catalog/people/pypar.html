              <b>PYPAR, COMMONLY KNOWN</b> as Pyp, is a member of the Night's Watch. He is in the same recruit class as Jon Snow, and is called Monkey by Ser Alliser Thorne.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pypar is small and has large ears which he can wiggle. He claims to be able to identify a person's origin by their accent. Pyp can imitate a hundred different voices and loves to act. He enjoys teasing his friend, Grenn. Samwell Tarly thinks Pyp has stupid japes.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Pypar joins the Night's Watch at the same time as Jon Snow. During sword practice, Jon thinks Pyp uses his sword like a dagger. He befriends Jon and helps defend Samwell Tarly when he arrives at the Wall.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyp is named to the rangers when Ser Alliser Thorne believes him ready to man the Wall, and he informs Jon that King Robert I Baratheon has died. Pyp is among the group of friends who stop Jon from abandoning the Night's Watch and forswearing himself.<br>
