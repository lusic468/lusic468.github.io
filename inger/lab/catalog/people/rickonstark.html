              <b>EDDARD AND CATELYN'S</b> youngest child, Rickon is only three years old when the series begins. Rickon is a naturally aggressive and strong-willed child, but his youth makes it difficult for him to cope with the terrible changes that come to his family and life. He is usually accompanied by his direwolf, Shaggydog.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born at Winterfell in 295 AC, Rickon is the third son and fifth child of Catelyn' and Eddard, head of House Stark; and younger brother to Robb Stark, the King in the North. Rickon has two older sisters, Sansa and Arya, another older brother Bran and a bastard half-brother, Jon Snow.
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Rickon adopts one of the direwolves found by the Starks and names it Shaggydog. After his father departs Winterfell and his mother lingers grief stricken at Bran's bedside, he follows Robb around, crying. When he learns that Robb is leaving too, he becomes very upset and is later found in the crypts of Winterfell, where he attacks two men with Shaggydog and an iron sword taken from one of the tombs. When Robb departs, he refuses to bid farewell. Shortly after Eddard's death in King's Landing, both Bran and Rickon share a vision of their father's spirit in the crypts.</p>
