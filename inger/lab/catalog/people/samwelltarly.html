            <b>SAMWELL TARLY IS</b> the eldest son of Lord Randyll Tarly and his wife Melessa Florent. A recruit of the Night's Watch originally from House Tarly, he is popularly called Sam.<br>
            Samwell is very fat, with dark hair, pale eyes, and a large moon-shaped face. Jon Snow originally estimates Samwell to weigh 20 stone (127 kg/280 lbs). Samwell is fond of music and songs, and prefers books over weapons and soft fabrics over armor. He is also a timid craven, afraid of blood and violence. Although he is insecure and awkward, Sam is observant and intelligent.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samwell was the first child of Randyll Tarly, Lord of Horn Hill, and his wife, Melessa Florent. Randyll, regarded as one of the finest military commanders in the Seven Kingdoms, did everything in his power to raise his son into what he deemed a proper heir, but Samwell frustrated him at every opportunity, resisting every effort made to change his nature. A dozen masters-at-arms failed to toughen him. Attempts such as dressing him in his mother's clothes, forcing him to sleep in chainmail, and even being bathed in aurochs blood by Qartheen warlocks failed to raise his valor. He even wept to see a chicken slaughtered. Lord Tarly had Sam thrown into a Horn Hill's pond to teach his son to swim, but Ser Hyle Hunt had to rescue the boy.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam once accompanied his father on a trip to the Arbor, but the Redwyne twins Horas and Hobber bullied him and Lord Randyll brought him back home. Sam's mother revealed to him that Randyll had meant for Samwell to remain at the Arbor, to serve as Lord Paxter Redwyne's page and squire. Had Sam pleased Paxter, he would have been betrothed to his daughter, Desmera.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Lady Melessa bore her husband three girls, Samwell's brother Dickon was born. Dickon showed all of the physical vigor that Samwell lacked, and Randyll's attentions turned to raising his more promising younger son to take his place. For a time Sam was left to enjoy his music, food, and other soft pursuits, though Randyll forbade Samwell from traveling to Oldtown to study at the Citadel, horrified at the notion of a member of House Tarly wearing a maester's chain. To discourage the boy, Randyll had Sam chained and manacled to a wall for three days.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sam turned fifteen, his father bluntly told him that he was not worthy of their house's ancestral Valyrian steel sword, Heartsbane, and that he must join the Night's Watch and renounce his family name so that he would not stand in the way of Dickon's inheritance. Failing that, Randyll promised that Sam would suffer an unfortunate hunting accident on the morrow. Sam chose to take the black.
