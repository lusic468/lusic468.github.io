              <b>JON ARRYN WAS</b> a head of House Arryn whose titles included Lord of the Eyrie, Defender of the Vale, and Warden of the East. He served as Hand of the King to Robert I Baratheon from 283 AC until his unexpected death in 298 AC. Jon was the husband of Lady Lysa Arryn and father of Lord Robert Arryn, and he acted as a second father to Lord Eddard Stark and King Robert.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jon was born as the eldest son of Lord Jasper Arryn. Not much is known about his youth or his parents. He had a younger brother, Ronnel, and a sister, Alys, who married Ser Elys Waynwood. Jon was Keeper of the Gates of the Moon while his father lived, and after his father's death he named his brother Ronnel and later his cousin Denys to that position.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jon was married three times. His first marriage was to Jeyne Royce, but she died in childbed, their daughter stillborn. His second marriage was to Rowena Arryn, a cousin, who died of a winter chill during a childless marriage. Because he had no children, Jon had appointed a number of heirs who died one after another. The first was his nephew Elbert Arryn, the son of his younger brother Ronnel. After Elbert was executed by King Aerys II Targaryen, Denys became heir. He was of a lower branch of House Arryn, and had married Jon's niece. He was killed in the Battle of the Bells.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During Robert's Rebellion, Jon married a third time, this time to Lysa Tully, the daughter of Lord Hoster Tully, to gain his support and to secure an heir for the failing Arryn line. Their marriage was loveless. Lysa found Jon to be too old and hated his bad breath. After several miscarriages Lysa gave Jon a sickly son and heir, Robert Arryn.
