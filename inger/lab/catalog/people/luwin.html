              <b>A TIRELESS MAESTER,</b> Luwin, under the service of House Stark, is a small grey man with grey eyes and thinning hair. He has a robe of grey wool with voluminous sleeves. In the sleeves are sewn pockets, from which Luwin is always drawing things. His maester's collar is a simple choker, and he often tugs at the chain around his neck when he is uncomfortable. His turret at Winterfell is always so cluttered that it seems to Bran Stark a wonder that Luwin ever finds anything. He owns a bronze far-eye from Myr.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luwin is one of the few maesters who have bothered to study for the Valyrian steel link. He is skeptical of hedge wizards and Old Nan's stories, believing that children of the forest and giants are extinct.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presumably the replacement at Winterfell for Maester Walys, Luwin delivered all of the children of Lord Eddard Stark and Lady Catelyn Tully: Robb (who was born at Riverrun), Sansa, Bran, Arya, and Rickon Stark. Luwin educated the Stark children, as well as Eddard's bastard, Jon Snow, and Eddard's ward, Theon Greyjoy. For instance, he taught about maesters and stars to Jon, the history of the Night's Watch to Bran, and the historical lords of Winterfell to Theon. Luwin also treated Arya's cuts and scrapes.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luwin once made a boy out of pottery and threw it from Winterfell's walls to show Bran what would happen if the boy were to fall while climbing, but Bran ignored the warning.
