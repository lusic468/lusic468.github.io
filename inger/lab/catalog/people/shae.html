              <b>SHAE IS A</b> young camp follower who comes into the service of Tyrion Lannister. Shae is short and very pretty, with large dark eyes and black hair. She is around eighteen years old. Shae ran off when her father attempted to turn her into his kitchen wench and his whore.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Shae serves as a camp follower with Lord Tywin Lannister's army when Bronn brings her to Tyrion Lannister, who is looking for a female companion before the battle on the Green Fork. Tyrion sleeps with her both before and after the battle, taking a liking to her, and he decides to take her with him to King's Landing despite his father Tywin's explicit command not to take the whore to court.
