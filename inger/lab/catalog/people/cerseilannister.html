              <b>CERSEI LANNISTER IS</b> the only daughter and eldest child of Lord Tywin Lannister of Casterly Rock and his wife, Lady Joanna Lannister. She is the twin of her younger brother, Ser Jaime Lannister. After Robert's Rebellion, Cersei married King Robert I Baratheon and became Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. She is the mother of Prince Joffrey, Princess Myrcella, and Prince Tommen of House Baratheon of King's Landing.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they were children, Cersei and her twin-brother, Jaime, looked so alike not even their father, Tywin, could tell them apart. As adults, they still significantly resemble each other. Cersei is a strikingly beautiful woman, with golden hair, emerald green eyes, fair skin, and a slender, graceful figure.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cersei is willful, ambitious and has a certain low cunning. She is hungry and greedy for power. Cersei believes herself to be subtle and politically astute. She hates being excluded from power on account of her gender, and resents the customs and conventions put on her because she is female. She thinks of herself as a female version of her father, and feels slighted when people do not obey her commands as they would have done for Lord Tywin, but instead give her their counsel, or disagree with her, which she faults on her gender.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cersei is impatient, and never forgets a slight, whether real or imagined. She considers caution to be cowardice and disagreement for defiance. Her quick temper and her easily wounded pride frequently lead her to make rash decisions, and she rarely considers what unintended consequences her actions might have. She does not shy away from using sex as a weapon.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the conclusion of Robert's Rebellion, a marriage was arranged between Cersei and the new king, Robert I Baratheon, in order to seal the new royal house's alliance with House Lannister. Cersei and Robert were wed in 284 AC. She and Jaime had sex the morning of her wedding. Nonetheless, Cersei was at first enthralled by the happy crowds at the royal wedding. However, her enthusiasm for the match ended when Robert called her "Lyanna" during their first night together.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marriage rapidly deteriorated, and Cersei resumed her incestuous relationship with Jaime. She bore him three children (Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen), all of whom she successfully passed off as Robert's trueborn heirs. Although the king was away during the births of his children, Jaime was present for at least Joffrey's birth, though Cersei refused to let her brother hold the child, fearing people might start to suspect his true parentage. On one occasion, early in her marriage, Cersei became pregnant by Robert. Unwilling to give birth to Robert's child, she sent Jaime out to find a woman to cleanse her. Having grown to resent Robert over the years, Cersei took further care to ensure he did not impregnate her.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the early years of their marriage, Cersei declined Robert's invitations to hunt with him, as Robert's trips allowed her more time with Jaime. Because two of Robert's Estermont uncles from Greenstone had remained at court for half a year following Cersei's marriage, Robert insisted on repaying the visit, and Cersei and Jaime accompanied him for a two-week stay at Estermont. While there, Cersei suspected that Robert was sleeping with a cousin of his, and had Jaime follow Robert to confirms her suspicions. Cersei and Jaime slept together on Greenstone, and Cersei likes to believe that was the night their eldest son Joffrey was conceived.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Robert "claimed his rights" frequently during the early years of their marriage, his drinking led to him hurting Cersei during those encounters. When she confronted him once during their first year of marriage, Robert claimed it was because of the drink, and he was not to blame. When he tried to take another horn of ale, Cersei smashed her own horn in his face, chipping his tooth. Robert claimed not to remember anything of those nights, but Cersei believes otherwise, and is certain that Robert did recall what he did to her, but felt that pretending to forget was easier than facing the truth. Cersei, in turn, tried to pretend that Robert was Rhaegar during those years. Over time, Robert came to Cersei's bed less frequently, not even once a year.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True to Maggy's prophecy, Cersei had three children, while Robert sired several bastards. After Joffrey assaulted a pregnant cat, Robert suggested bringing a bastard daughter of his to court. Cersei threatened the girl, claiming King's Landing was a dangerous place for a girl growing up. Though Robert hit Cersei for that, the girl was not brought to court, and all of Robert's bastards were kept out of sight. According to Petyr Baelish, however, there are rumors that Robert fathered twins on a serving woman at Casterly Rock in 295 AC, and that Cersei had the babes killed and the mother sold to a slaver.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually Stannis Baratheon, familiar with the appearance of his brother Robert's black-haired, blue-eyed bastard offspring, grew suspicious of the royal children's lack of resemblance to their supposed father. He confided in Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, and the two investigated the matter together. After the tourney on Prince Joffrey's name day, Cersei and her children travelled with Lord Tywin to Casterly Rock. During the fortnight following the tourney, Jon was poisoned and fell ill, eventually dying before he could act. While Cersei was innocent of the fact, Stannis was convinced that she was responsible for Jon's death, and he fled to Dragonstone.
