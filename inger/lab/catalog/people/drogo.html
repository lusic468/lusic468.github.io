              <b>DROGO IS A</b> powerful khal or warlord of the fearsome Dothraki nomads. Daenerys Targaryen is promised to him at the beginning of A Song of Ice and Fire.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like most Dothraki, Drogo has copper-colored skin, black hair, and black eyes. He is tall and muscular, and moves gracefully. He has a long, drooping moustache and a long braid hung with tiny bells that hangs down to his thighs, symbolizing his status among the Dothraki as an undefeated warlord. Drogo's favorite horse is an unnamed lean red stallion, as it is not a Dothraki custom to give individual names to animals.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drogo's father was Khal Bharbo. Cohollo was pledged to the khalakka, or prince, while he was still a child, and saved young Drogo's life from sellswords on one occasion.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From an early age Drogo was an extraordinarily gifted warrior even among the fierce Dothraki; before the age of thirty he led a khalasar forty thousand strong, the largest on the Dothraki sea. He has never been defeated in battle. Cohollo, Qotho and Haggo serve him as bloodriders.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drogo owns a palace in the sacred Dothraki city of Vaes Dothrak. He also possesses a nine-towered manse in Pentos, given to him by the city's ruling magisters as part of their policy of bribing the Dothraki not to loot the city.
