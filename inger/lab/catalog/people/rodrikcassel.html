              <b>SER RODRIK CASSEL</b> is a knight from House Cassel and a member of the Stark household. He is the uncle of Jory Cassel and the master-at-arms of Winterfell,  in which capacity he trained Robb Stark, Jon Snow, and Theon Greyjoy at arms.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ser Rodrik is a stout man, broad, with large white whiskers. He does not like music. He is loyal and courageous.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, after the discovery of the Valyrian steel knife from the attempted assassination of Bran Stark, Rodrik accompanies Lady Catelyn Stark to King's Landing. They travel by sea. The voyage is a difficult one for Rodrik, who gets seasick and has to cut his whiskers because they become so soiled from vomit.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In King's Landing, Rodrik brings the Valyrian steel dagger to Ser Aron Santagar, the master-at-arms of the Red Keep, in a vain hope that he might recognize the blade. Afterwards he and Catelyn meet Petyr Baelish, who tells them that the knife that was used in the attempt on Bran was owned by Tyrion Lannister. After telling Lord Eddard Stark about the attempt on Bran, the Starks decide that Catelyn should return to Winterfell. On the way back to Winterfell, at the crossroads inn in the riverlands they meet Tyrion Lannister, who recognizes Catelyn. Because of what Baelish has told her, Catelyn holds Tyrion responsible for the attack on her son and takes the Imp prisoner.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catelyn takes Tyrion to the Vale where her sister, Lysa Arryn resides, in order to confuse her enemies. During the ride through the Mountains of the Moon, they are twice set upon by the Vale mountain clans. In the first skirmish Rodrik bests the group's champion, but is seriously wounded, suffering a deep gash in his left arm and a spear graze to his neck. He makes it to the Bloody Gate only by being tied to his saddle. There he is left to recover from his wounds. By demanding a trial by combat that his champion Bronn wins, Tyrion is able to regain his freedom. Lady Catelyn decides to join Robb at Moat Cailin, and names Ser Rodrik castellan of Winterfell; he returns there via White Harbor.
