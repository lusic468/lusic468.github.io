              <b>RENLY BARATHEON IS</b> the Lord of Storm's End and Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. The younger brother of King Robert I and Lord Stannis, Renly serves as master of laws on Robert's small council.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born in 277 AC, Renly was the youngest of the three sons of Lord Steffon Baratheon and Lady Cassana Estermont.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renly grew up at Storm's End. Only a boy of six at the time of Robert's Rebellion, he spent the war under siege in Storm's End, together with his older brother, Stannis, where he was witness to the desperation of the starving garrison.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a boy, Renly loved bright colors and fabrics. He loved games as well, and would run laughing through the halls of Storm's End.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By his older brother Robert, Renly was eventually granted the seat of Storm's End and named Lord Paramount of the Stormlands, upsetting Stannis, who felt that, as the elder of the two, Storm's End was his by right.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Renly turned sixteen, he made a lord's progress across the stormlands to mark his coming of age. During this progress, he also visited the isle of Tarth, where Renly courteously danced with Brienne of Tarth.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Princess Arianne Martell recalls that Renly also visited Sunspear once. She had tried her best to seduce Renly, but remembers that he had seemed more bemused than inflamed by her attempts.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During his time as Lord of Storm's End, Renly took Loras Tyrell as his page and squire. This was likely the start of their clandestine love affair. Although not widely known, their forbidden relationship is known to various others at court.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renly was eventually named to the small council, where he occupied the position of master of laws. While he is at court, his castellan at Storm's End is Ser Cortnay Penrose, who raises King Robert's bastard son, Edric Storm, for them. Brella runs Renly's household in King's Landing for him.
