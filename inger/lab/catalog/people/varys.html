              <b>VARYS, CALLED "THE</b> Spider", is an enigmatic member of the small council and the master of whisperers, or spymaster, for the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Varys was born as a slave in Lys, according to Grand Maester Pycelle. Varys himself says that he was orphaned, and was apprenticed to a traveling folly, a troupe of mummers who worked the Free Cities, Oldtown, and occasionally King's Landing, by means of a fat little cog owned by the troupe's master. During their stay in Myr, a man offered a large sum of money for Varys, an offer his master found too tempting to refuse. The man gave Varys a potion that made him powerless to move or speak, but did nothing to dull his senses as his manhood was cut off at the stem, then burnt in a brazier in a Blood Magic ritual. Varys claims to have held a hatred for all things magical ever since.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the ritual complete, the man had no further use for Varys and tossed him out on the streets. Varys asked the man what he should do, to which the sorcerer replied he supposed that he should die. Varys to spite him vowed to live. By that time the mummers had sailed and Varys was left alone. He resorted to begging, prostitution and thievery and soon was as good a thief as any in Myr, eventually becoming recognized as the best thief in the city, until a rival forced him out and he fled to Pentos.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Pentos, Varys was marked by his accent, and once it became known he was a eunuch, he was despised and beaten. Varys was poor, and slept in sewers during the day, whilse prowling the rooftops at night. He made an agreement with a poor sellsword named Illyrio Mopatis, and together they started a business, where Varys would steal objects from lesser thieves and Illyrio would get the objects back for their original owners for a small fee. Soon, everyone in Pentos who ever had valuables stolen from them knew who to ask to get their belongings back. In addition, the thieves in Pentos soon began to seek Varys out, half to try (and failing) to kill him, the other half to sell him the objects they had stolen in order to prevent Varys from stealing them. Varys and Illyrio quickly grew rich.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Varys came to the realization that information was much more valuable than gold and gems and began training his spy network, then known as "little mice", to acquire the information, letters, ledgers and charts of the wealthy and powerful. The "mice" were orphans purchased by Varys; he chose those that were small, quick, and quiet, and taught them to read and write, as well as the skills required for sneak thievery such as climbing walls and slipping down chimneys, so that they might copy the information Varys desired without disturbing or alarming their targets.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These secrets increased Varys and Illyrio's wealth tenfold, and in time Varys became so infamous that word of his talents reached the ears of King Aerys across the narrow sea, who in his growing paranoia no longer trusted his son, his wife, or his Hand.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As spymaster in King's Landing, Varys's influence grew with Aerys's paranoia, as he was quick to point out traitors and schemers to his liege. Varys mastered the secret passages within the Red Keep and made good use of them with his spy network, who became known as his little birds. He had them memorize the passages and come to him whenever one discovered something of importance. Notably, Varys alerted Aerys to the possibility that his son Rhaegar was using attendance at the Tourney at Harrenhal as a pretext to rally Lords to his cause in removing Aerys as king, causing Aerys to attend the tournament, the first time he had left the Red Keep in years since the Defiance of Duskendale.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the Battle of the Trident during Robert's Rebellion, Varys counseled Aerys to close his gates to Tywin Lannister, as he could not be trusted. Aerys, however, listened to Grand Maester Pycelle and opened the gates to the Lannister forces, who proceeded to sack the city and kill the remaining Targaryens present.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he continued in his post for King Robert, Varys's loyalty seemingly remained with House Targaryen. He kept a secret arrangement with Illyrio Mopatis, who seeks to put a Targaryen back on the Iron Throne. In fact, it was revealed that Varys switched the baby Aegon with that of a peasant baby. With the realm and Robert falsely believing him dead, Varys had Aegon smuggled across the narrow sea to be raised by Rhaegar's friend and exiled Hand of the King, Jon Connington. To conceal Connington's activities, Varys concocted the false story that Connington had drunk himself to death after being caught stealing from the Golden Company.<br>
