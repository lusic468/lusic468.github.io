              <b>OSHA IS A</b> free folk woman who becomes a captive of Winterfell and later a servant of House Stark.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Osha is a spearwife from north of the Wall. She is described as tough and uncomplaining. She worships the old gods of the forest and is knowledgeable about them, as well as the lands beyond the Wall and their inhabitants.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Osha travels with three other wildlings and a pair of Night's Watch deserters, Stiv and Wallen. This group flees south of the Wall, trying to escape the Others. They cross the Wall and travel into the wolfswood north of Winterfell, where they come upon the crippled Bran Stark. Osha wants to take him hostage and return to Mance Rayder, presumably to use him to gain passage south through the Wall. Robb Stark, Theon Greyjoy, Grey Wind, and Summer arrive to rescue him and all of the band are killed, except Osha. She is taken back to Winterfell for questioning. She is eventually given a limited freedom of the castle for her good behavior and employed as a kitchen servant.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Osha goes to pray to the the old gods in the godswood and comes upon Bran as he finishes his prayers. She is wearing chains on her legs. The two bond to a degree, sharing a common devotion to the old gods. She tells him that when the weirwood leaves are rustling in the wind, it means the old gods are listening. She also says that the old gods have no power in the south because the weirwoods are gone. She says that Robb is marching the wrong way, and that she has been trying to warn him that the Others are coming, but was ignored.
