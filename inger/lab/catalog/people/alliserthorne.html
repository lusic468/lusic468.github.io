            <b>SER ALLISER THORNE</b> is a knight from House Thorne who now serves as the master-at-arms of the Night's Watch at Castle Black. While capable, he is bitter and humorless, and is particularly hated by the recruits of the Night's Watch who have been trained by him.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to joining the Night's Watch, Alliser was a knight of House Thorne in the crownlands and fought on the side of House Targaryen during Robert's Rebellion. Following the Sack of King's Landing, he was given the choice by Lord Tywin Lannister between death or taking the black.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As master-at-arms responsible for training new recruits, Ser Alliser gives Jon Snow the mocking nickname "Lord Snow". His disdain turns into hatred when Jon replies to one of his mockeries, provoking the hilarity of the whole common room of Castle Black. Having absolutely no humor, he takes the mockeries of Tyrion Lannister poorly when Tyrion is invited to the table of the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, Jeor Mormont, during his visit to the Wall. Alliser is, however, so delighted at Jon's appointment to the stewards that Jon thinks he is behind it.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alliser never misses an occasion to provoke the young bastard. The evening Jon learns of the imprisonment of his father, Lord Eddard Stark, in King's Landing for treason, Alliser's jeers anger Jon, who tries to attack him with a knife, before being stopped and put under arrest. This mutual hostility, and the master-at-arms' old friends who are well-placed at court, lead the Lord Commander to send Alliser to the new king, Joffrey I Baratheon, with the mission to acquire reinforcements for the Night's Watch.
