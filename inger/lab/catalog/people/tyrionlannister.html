              <b>TYRION LANNISTER IS</b> a member of House Lannister and is the third and youngest child of Lord Tywin Lannister and the late Joanna Lannister. His older siblings are Cersei Lannister, the queen of King Robert Baratheon, and Ser Jaime Lannister, a knight of Robert's Kingsguard. Tyrion is a dwarf; because of this he is sometimes mockingly called the Imp and the Halfman.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tyrion was born in 273 AC as the third-born child to Lord Tywin and Lady Joanna Lannister. Joanna died giving birth to him, and as a result his father blames him for her death. Tales about Tyrion were spread immediately after his birth; At Oldtown, it was said that Tyrion was a monster, with a tail, monstrous huge head, thick black hair, a beard, an evil eye, lion's claws, with teeth so long he was not able to close his mouth, and both male and female genitals. It was said that Tyrion's birth was an omen to famine, plague and war, and the smallfolk named him “Lord Tywin's Doom” and “Lord Tywin's Bane”. King Aerys II Targaryen stated that Tyrion was a punishment for Tywin's arrogance, and the same was said by begging brothers in Oldtown, stating that Tywin had made himself greater than the king, which was only allowed by a god.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after Tyrion's birth, the Princess of Dorne arrived with her consort and two younger children, Elia and Oberyn Martell. Tyrion was kept out of sight during the visit of the Martells, though he could sometimes he heard, howling. Cersei and Jaime show Tyrion to Elia and Oberyn the day before the Martells leave. Cersei claims that no one had expected Tyrion to live this long, and that he must surely die soon. Lord Tywin Lannister, having refused to betroth Princess Elia to his heir Jaime, offers the newborn Tyrion as a betrothed to Elia instead, which the Martells took as an insult.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During most of Tyrion's childhood, his father Tywin served as Hand of the King to King Aerys II Targaryen in King's Landing, and as a consequence was absent from home for longer periods of time. As a child, Tyrion was lonely. His brother Jaime left Casterly Rock to serve as a squire at Crakehall in 277 AC, while his sister Cersei left for the court of King's Landing in 278 AC. At the age of six or seven, one of his uncles taught him tumbling, which he happily did for half a year at Casterly Rock, until Tywin returned from King's Landing and forbade it. Knowing he would never be a knight, as a child Tyrion thought he could become the High Septon instead, as the crystal crown added a foot to one's height. As such, he studied the holy books. However, at the age of thirteen, Tyrion fell in love, and that quickly replaced the thoughts of priesthood. He and his brother Jaime rescued a common girl, Tysha, from some bandits near Casterly Rock. While Jaime went after the bandits Tyrion took care of Tysha. To his amazement Tysha liked him, and they eventually made love. Tyrion became so enamoured by her that he bribed a septon and married her in secret. Tysha would sing the Myrish song "The Seasons of My Love" for him. Their marriage lasted only two weeks, however. When Tyrion's father learned about the wedding, he commanded Jaime to say that Tysha was a prostitute whom Jaime had hired for to take Tyrion's virginity. Because the “whore” had presumed to marry a Lannister, Tywin had his guards rape Tysha for a silver each and then made Tyrion go last for a gold coin, stating that a Lannister was worth more.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was younger, Tyrion used to dream of owning a dragon of his own, going as far as asking his uncles for one as a nameday present. He used to start fires in the bowels of Casterly Rock, and stared at them for hours, pretending they were dragonflame, while he himself was a lost Targaryen princeling, or a dragonlord from Valyria. Sometimes, he imagined that he saw his father or sister burning in the fires. As he grew older, Tyrion would seldom ever dream of dragons, though he would always remain fascinated by them.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tywin Lannister had been discussing a betrothal between Tyrion's brother Jaime and the youngest daughter of Lord Hoster Tully, Lysa. However, Jaime was named to the Kingsguard in 281 AC, making him unavailable for marriage. Tywin offered Tyrion as a replacement, only to be told by Lord Hoster that his daughter required a “whole man”. Tywin later tried to offer Tyrion to Lords Yohn Royce and Leyton Hightower, but they took it in a similar fashion as the Princess of Dorne had done so years before. Tywin even offered Tyrion as a husband to Delena Florent, who had been deflowered by King Robert I Baratheon, but Ser Colin Florent preferred to marry his daughter to Ser Hosman Norcross instead.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a young boy, Tyrion had committed to learn all sixteen of the wonders described by Lomas Longstrider to memory, and occasionally recited them during feasts. For years, he dreamed that one day he could travel the world and see them himself. In 289 AC, when he became a man at sixteen, he wanted to take a tour of the nine Free Cities, as his uncles Gerion and Tygett had done. Tywin forbade him to go, and instead, gave him charge of all the cisterns and drains at Casterly Rock. When Tyrion was eighteen, his uncle Gerion left on a journey for Valyria to recover the ancient Valyrian steel blade Brightroar which had once belonged to House Lannister. Lord Tywin forbade Tyrion to go in this journey as well.</p>
