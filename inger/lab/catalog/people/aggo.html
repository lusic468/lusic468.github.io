              <b>AGGO IS A</b> Dothraki horserider of Daenerys Targaryen's khas who later becomes one of her bloodriders.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Aggo is one of four Dothraki warriors assigned to the khas of Daenerys Targaryen within the khalasar of Khal Drogo. He accompanies Daenerys during her visit to the Western Market in Vaes Dothrak. He helps stop an assassination attempt on Daenerys's life by a wineseller.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Daenerys attempts to heal Drogo with Mirri Maz Duur's aid, his bloodriders attempt to stop her. Cohollo is prevented from slitting Daenerys's throat when he is killed by an arrow from Aggo.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Daenerys names Aggo ko and asks him to become one of her bloodriders alongside Jhogo and Rakharo, she offers him the dragonbone bow she received as a present during her wedding. He is at first reluctant, but he accepts after the dragons are born.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next book, During their journey across the red waste, Aggo tells Daenerys that Drogon is Balerion the Black Dread reincarnated. While her khalasar rests in Vaes Tolorro after crossing the red waste, Daenerys orders her three bloodriders to scout out the country, each one in a different direction. Aggo leaves to the south-west, where he find nothing but sterile desert and the ruins of two abandoned cities, one of which is warded by skulls and the other where he finds an iron bracelet, which he brings back to Daenerys. He is the second bloodrider to come back to Vaes Tolorro. After his return, Daenerys sets him to repairing the gates to defend the town should they come under attack.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aggo accompanies Daenerys to the House of the Undying, where he asks her to allow him and Jhogo to go with her and protect her as her sworn bloodrider, though Daenerys insists there are places even a khal must walk alone.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, Aggo, along with Jhogo, rides with Daenerys to Qarth's waterfront to seek a ship, where he buys a skewer of honey-roasted mice to eat. He rushes to Daenerys's aid during her second near assassination attempt and seizes Arstan Whitebeard's staff. He draws his arakh on Strong Belwas when the latter mocks him, but he stands down on the orders of Daenerys.
