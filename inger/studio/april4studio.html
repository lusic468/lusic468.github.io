    <div class="about">
      <p>Cuban-born F&eacute;lix Gonz&aacute;lez-Torres was a Postmodernist installation artist that worked primarily with minimalism and participatory art. He studied photography as a student in New York City in the late '70s.<br>
      Gonz&aacute;lez-Torres was openly gay and a common thread in his works is that they reflect on his relationship with his late lover, Ross. Almost all of them were made as political commentary on the concurrent AIDS epidemic that took both Ross and Gonz&aacute;lez-Torres himself. The themes of duality and mortality (as well as their relationship) are also heavily expressed (ie. "Untitled (Perfect Lovers)" [1991]). As a minimalist, Gonz&aacute;lez-Torres' works don't have titles, but instead parenthetical ones. His most famous work, called "Untitled (Portrait of Ross in L.A.)" (1991) is a pile of candy that, when placed in a gallery space or the like, can be eaten slowly by the patrons that come through.<br>
      This participatory art, called process art, was used often by Gonz&aacute;lez-Torres to make a commentary on the deteriorating effects of living with HIV and then AIDS. Due to gross malcontent with the ways that the US government was handling the AIDS epidemic, many of his works also reflect on contemporary US culture, pharmaceuticals, and US war efforts.</p>
