  <p><h2>&ldquo;Small Talk&rdquo; Questions</h2>
  <h3><em>What can we learn from this letter about the user experience?</em></h3>
  <p>Even a new, if not foreign, program should be learnable and manipulable.<br><br>

  <h3><em>How extendable was this system?</em></h3>
  The system is pretty limited by what you can do as far as manipulating objects on screen, but Marian seemed to be able to use its full extent nonetheless.<br>
  As well as being able to create your own programs, which Marian did with her friend Colleen. The extendibility of their program requires that you know how to rotate, move, and scale polygons on screen; beyond that was illustration and design.<br><br>

  <h3><em>Points in which the user was on-boarded?</em></h3>
  When she first started the program, she was shown how to load the disk into the computer and then load the file with the program on it.<br>
  She was taught how to create her own programs.<br>
  She was also taught how to make the polygons follow her cursor.<br><br>
