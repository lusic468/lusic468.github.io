          Mid-century philosopher Michel Foucault cites in his introduction to <em>The History of Sexuality</em> that the early seventeenth century was one who possessed a &ldquo;certain frankness&rdquo;. &ldquo;Sexual practices had little need of secrecy; words were said without undue reticence,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It was a time of direct gestures, shameless discourse, and open transgressions, [. . .] bodies &lsquo;made a display of themselves.&rsquo;&rdquo; (3) Then the Industrial Revolution happened and suddenly it seemed people weren&rsquo;t allowed to have time for those kinds of things. As the rich became more pompous and the aristocracy rose (and then didn&rsquo;t) in France, as the British saw great domestic wealth and colonial expansion, as Puritanism and the Enlightenment spread across cotton- and tobacco-producing America [Foucault even acknowledges the American Christian pastoral, 21], society became one enamored by conservatism with a heavy focus on domestic gross product per capita. Foucault writes, &ldquo;At a time when labor capacity was being systematically exploited, how could this capacity be allowed to dissipate itself in pleasurable pursuits [. . .]?&rdquo; (6) Religion and its heavy influences on America&rsquo;s Enlightened government only piqued this social phenomenon. While we won&rsquo;t forget what else was going on in the Western world at this time (that is, the plebeian farmers in France were eating dirt, children and women were being systematically abused through dangerous forced labor in British assembly lines, slavery was institutionalized across America and beyond), it makes pointing out this society&rsquo;s attitudes toward sex virtually irrelevant. Although, this doesn&rsquo;t necessarily diminish the interestingness of the observation.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the waves of Feminism at the turn of the 20th century, toward its end, and at present, sexuality and its social expressions have witnessed some liberation. This is especially true in the era of internet porn, Grindr/Tinder, and other various social media. While we&rsquo;ve come some way from Foucault&rsquo;s view point of the 1960s and &rsquo;70s&mdash;which was dominated by Pop, throw-away culture, nuclear families, nuclear threats, missile crises, the Space Race, household products and their advertisements, church Sundays, Postmodernism, the Vietnam War, oh my god&mdash;many would agree that our contemporary generation is still dealing with much of the same shit. Sexual repression has lightened thanks to the developments of Freud, Berlant, Butler, Muñoz, and those that preceded/followed them, but it still remains by-and-large.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The younger generation who grew up with &rsquo;90s television, 2000s pop culture, and the Internet has a perception of sexual expression and orientation that is much more open-minded. As a member of this generation, I can attest to its fixation on tying together romance, sex, and social interaction (which is not unique to my generation; we&rsquo;ve found new ways of expressing these urges on digital media platforms). But then again, as Foucault warns, &ldquo;We will not be able to free ourselves from it except at a considerable cost; nothing less than a transgression of laws, a lifting of prohibitions, an irruption of speech, a reinstating of pleasure within reality, and a whole new economy in the mechanisms of power will be required.&rdquo; (Foucault 5) This pretty-big statement can more-or-less be translated as &ldquo;Global capitalism, whose healthy omnipresence affects many nations&rsquo; socio-political spheres, will always require that its workers remain focused and unhindered by leisure and pleasure.&rdquo; Until the time comes that work is no longer needed, we will never be fully sexually liberated.
