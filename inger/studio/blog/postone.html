          In attempting to learn about queer theory, I&rsquo;ve come across a few snags that I think most people naturally trip on when studying lofty topics on their own. The main thing I keep feeling is this FOMO from knowing all these other stories and essays are out there ready to help (better) explain the ever-growing discipline of study that is queer theory. By this point I&rsquo;ve done a bit of reading, but I think it&rsquo;s save to assume I&rsquo;ll never have read enough on the subject.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing one must realize about queer theory is that, even though it&rsquo;s a relatively newer discipline, it has been one that encompasses just about every other kind of discipline. Because of its relation to gender and sexuality, queer theory can really be plugged into any context involving human beings. Scholars and theorists have taken to applying queer theory to daily life as Dr David M. Halperin of the University of Michigan says in his essay &ldquo;The Normalization of Queer Theory&rdquo;. Because queer theory is &ldquo;often abstracted from the quotidian realities of lesbian and gay male life&rdquo;, it has &ldquo;re-opened the question of the relations between sexuality and gender, both as analytic categories and as lived experiences&rdquo; (343, 341). The beginnings of queer theory weren&rsquo;t always like that though.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before <em>queer</em> came to identify this entire school of thought, it was branched under gender studies and feminism as the scholars who frequented queer subjects also aligned with those more &ldquo;fruity&rdquo; topics. Feminism at the time that queer theory came to be was more polarized in its thinking, as feminists stressed sexual difference between masculine and feminine forces. While they also noted their similarities for the sake of equality, the narrative that masculinity and feminity are at odds (whether the degree is extreme in the form of misogyny or minor in the form of androgyny) is still ongoing. Within the lesbian and gay communities, women saw it as a democratic way of having sexual and romantic relationships. Men inherently have ageist bias toward sexual and romantic partners, thus the age gap between men and women in marriages is considered an objective partnership (think of Hugh Hefner and his Bunnies). Lesbian partnerships aren&rsquo;t inherently so. Even though queer theory and gender theory have close proximity to one another historically and politically, Sharon Marcus makes an excellent observation in distinguishing the two:
          </p><br><br>
          <em><p class="body quote">It could be argued that by undermining gender as a stable category, queer theory undermines feminism, which depends on the concept of women. However, this fear is groundless, for two reasons. First, queer theory does not completely abandon the concept of gender, since homosexuality depends on assigning a gender to oneself and to the people to whom one is sexually attracted. Queer theory simply refuses the strict limits that heterosexism sets on the possible configurations of genders, bodies, and desires. Second, since feminism is by definition invested in changing women&rsquo;s social and political positions, the concept of woman on which feminism rests is mobile, not static, and thus not at risk from the kinds of plasticity that queer theory ascribes to gender.</em> (200)</p>
          <br><br>
          <p class="body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To zoom out a bit, there&rsquo;s a frustration apparent amongst scholars that this school of theory isn&rsquo;t holistic enough&mdash;I would agree. Since queer scholarship occupies two levels of resource (one much more accessible where medicine, politics, law, and published works live and the other where much more specific things like personal letters, art, and oral history live), it&rsquo;s difficult to find common ground amongst all the sources in which queer theory is attached. In Marcus&rsquo;s review essay, she expresses a call to action in the essay&rsquo;s conclusion to synthesize already-existing sources of queer scholarship while simultaneously expanding its realm. Even though queer theory encompasses so much, really the only people that think so are those actually studying it (213).
