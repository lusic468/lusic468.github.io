          Queer theory has a complex, albeit shorter, history that is multilayered and highly intersectional. Due to the development in the &rsquo;80s and &rsquo;90s of queer theory, contemporary opinions have departed from a more lesbian-gay-attentive &lsquo;LGBT community&rsquo; of the 20th century to one that includes the entire queer spectrum, that is people who identify gender&mdash;and lack thereof&mdash; or orientate sexuality&mdash;and lack thereof&mdash;beyond what is deemed the heteronorm. </p><p class="body cobey"<br><br>
          Cobey is a designer and artist born in Austin, Texas currently living in New York City. As an undergraduate Communication Design student attending Parsons The New School for Design, he&rsquo;s interested in the expansion of multilingual design that demonstrates an equitable, if not completely democratic, interest in diverse audiences in the contexts of publication, branding, or even film.<br>
	        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prospectively, Cobey will explore the intersectionality of design and visual language and how that can be implemented with regard to multilingual editorial, typography, and motion graphics.<br>
	        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now, he is simply trying to stay well-fed and complete his degree. During his free time, Cobey likes to walk while listening to audiobooks by Jim Dale or songs by The Arcade Fire and the like.
