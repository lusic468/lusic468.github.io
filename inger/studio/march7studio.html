  <p><h2>Design Theme Articulation</h2>
   Design can be summed up by the word manipulation in the sense that media, opinions, materials,  and people can all be manipulated in some way by design as a mediator or cause. For me, I define design as creativity with rules and limits, and these limits whether they are followed or not manipulate the ways designers manipulate. For example, style trends affect the ways in which contemporary designers as a whole design specific things for people. Also, preexisting rules of style (such as typographic style, editorial style, UX/UI style, etc.) manipulate, or confine, a designerâ€™s methods of manipulating media. This media in turn can then manipulate its audience, depending on the purpose. Politically charged design can potentially sway the belief of a person, or evoke a strong emotion. Design with motifs of older styles could trigger a nostalgia in the viewer, also affecting their emotions. Essentially, design can potentially toy with its audience's free will (to a short extent). It is said that the best design does just this without anyone noticing.</p>
